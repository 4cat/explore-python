之旅\nPython 简介\nPython 诞生于 1989 年的圣诞期间，由 Guido van Rossum 开发而成，目前 Guido 仍然是 Python 的主要开发者，主导着 Python 的发展方向，Python 社区经常称呼他为仁慈的独裁者。\nPython 是一门面向对象，解释型的高级程序设计语言，它的语法非常简洁、优雅，而这也是 Python 的一些设计哲学。Python 自带了很完善的库，涵盖了数据库，网络，文件处理，GUI 等方方面面，通过这些库，我们可以比较快速地解决一些棘手问题，也可以将其作为基础库，开发出一些高级库。\n目前 Python 在大部分领域都占有一席之地，比如 Web 开发，机器学习，科学计算等。不少大型网站都是使用 Python 作为后台开发语言的，比如 YouTube、Pinterest、国内的豆瓣和知乎等。另外，有不少知名的机器学习库也是使用 Python 开发的，比如，scikit-learn 是一个强大的机器学习库，Theano 是一个成熟的深度学习库。\n当然了，Python 也有一些缺点。Python 经常被人们吐槽的一点就是：运行速度慢，和 C/C++ 相比非常慢。但是，除了像视频高清解码等计算密集型任务对运行速度有较高的要求外，在大部分时候，我们可能并不需要非常快的运行速度。比如，一个程序使用 C 来实现，运行时间只需 0.01 秒，而使用 Python 来实现，需要 0.1 秒，虽然 Python 的运行时间是 C 的 10 倍，显然很慢，但对我们而言，这压根不是问题。\n关于本书\n本书是我学习和使用 Python 的总结。一开始，我也没想过要写这么多章节，当时只是挑选了感兴趣的知识点，希望能用深入浅出的方式把它们写清楚，以加深对它们的理解，而不是停留在「感觉好像懂了」的状态中。通过这种方式，我对一些概念的理解也越来越深入，以至于在后面写的时候，我发现以往的知识经验越来越不够用，于是就继续写，越写越多。\n我在本书的写作中，给自己提了一个要求：尽量深入浅出，条理清晰。至于是否达到了，希望读者们批评指正，并给我提意见和建议。\n本书的每章基本都是独立的，读者可以挑选感兴趣的章节进行阅读。本书目前有 15 个章节，目录结构如下：\n\n第 1 章：介绍一些基础知识，包括 Python 中的输入和输出，字符编码。\n第 2 章：介绍 Python 中的基本数据类型，比如字符串、列表和字典等。\n第 3 章：介绍 Python 中的函数。\n第 4 章：介绍 Python 中的函数式编程，包括闭包和装饰器等。\n第 5 章：介绍 Python 中类的使用，以及一些特殊方法。\n第 6 章：介绍 Python 中的高级特性，比如生成器，上下文管理器。\n第 7 章：文件和目录操作。\n第 8 章：进行、线程和协程。\n第 9 章：错误和异常处理。\n第 10 章：正则表达式。\n第 11 章：HTTP 服务。\n第 12 章：测试。\n第 13 章：一些标准模块的使用。\n第 14 章：一些第三方模块的使用。\n第 15 章：结束语。\n\n另外，本书使用的 Python 版本是

等，我都觉得非常有必要厘清计算机中的字符编码概念。本文主要分以下几个部分介绍：\n\n基本概念\n常见字符编码简介\nPython 的默认编码\nPython2 中的字符类型\nUnicodeEncodeError &amp; UnicodeDecodeError 根源\n\n基本概念\n\n字符（Character）\n\n在电脑和电信领域中，字符是一个信息单位，它是各种文字和符号的总称，包括各国家文字、标点符号、图形符号、数字等。比如，一个汉字，一个英文字母，一个标点符号等都是一个字符。\n\n字符集（Character set）\n\n字符集是字符的集合。字符集的种类较多，每个字符集包含的字符个数也不同。比如，常见的字符集有 ASCII 字符集、GB2312 字符集、Unicode 字符集等，其中，ASCII 字符集共有 128 个字符，包含可显示字符（比如英文大小写字符、阿拉伯数字）和控制字符（比如空格键、回车键）；GB2312 字符集是中国国家标准的简体中文字符集，包含简化汉字、一般符号、数字等；Unicode 字符集则包含了世界各国语言中使用到的所有字符，\n\n字符编码（Character encoding）\n\n字符编码，是指对于字符集中的字符，将其编码为特定的二进制数，以便计算机处理。常见的字符编码有 ASCII 编码，UTF-8 编码，GBK 编码等。一般而言，字符集和字符编码往往被认为是同义的概念，比如，对于字符集 ASCII，它除了有「字符的集合」这层含义外，同时也包含了「编码」的含义，也就是说，ASCII 既表示了字符集也表示了对应的字符编码。\n下面我们用一个表格做下总结：\n\n\n\n概念\n概念描述\n举例\n\n\n\n\n字符\n一个信息单位，各种文字和符号的总称\n‘中’, ‘a&#39;, ‘1&#39;, &#39;$&#39;, ‘￥’, ...\n\n\n字符集\n字符的集合\nASCII 字符集, GB2312 字符集, Unicode 字符集\n\n\n字符编码\n将字符集中的字符，编码为特定的二进制数\nASCII 编码，GB2312 编码，Unicode 编码\n\n\n字节\n计算机中存储数据的单元，一个 8 位（bit）的二进制数\n0x01, 0x45, ...\n\n\n\n常见字符编码简介\n常见的字符编码有 ASCII 编码，GBK 编码，Unicode 编码和 UTF-8 编码等等。这里，我们主要介绍 ASCII、Unicode 和 UTF-8。\nASCII\n计算机是在美国诞生的，人家用的是英语，而在英语的世界里，不过就是英文字母，数字和一些普通符号的组合而已。\n在 20 世纪 60 年代，美国制定了一套字符编码方案，规定了英文字母，数字和一些普通符号跟二进制的转换关系，被称为 ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange，美国信息互换标准编码) 码。\n比如，大写英文字母 A 的二进制表示是 01000001（十进制 65），小写英文字母 a 的二进制表示是 01100001 （十进制 97），空格 SPACE 的二进制表示是 00100000（十进制 32）。\nUnicode\nASCII 码只规定了 128 个字符的编码，这在美国是够用的。可是，计算机后来传到了欧洲，亚洲，乃至世界各地，而世界各国的语言几乎是完全不一样的，用 ASCII 码来表示其他语言是远远不够的，所以，不同的国家和地区又制定了自己的编码方案，比如中国大陆的 GB2312 编码 和 GBK 编码等，日本的 Shift_JIS 编码等等。\n虽然各个国家和地区可以制定自己的编码方案，但不同国家和地区的计算机在数据传输的过程中就会出现各种各样的乱码（mojibake），这无疑是个灾难。\n怎么办？想法也很简单，就是将全世界所有的语言统一成一套编码方案，这套编码方案就叫 Unicode，它为每种语言的每个字符设定了独一无二的二进制编码，这样就可以跨语言，跨平台进行文本处理了，是不是很棒！\nUnicode 1.0 版诞生于 1991 年 10 月，至今它仍在不断增修，每个新版本都会加入更多新的字符，目前最新的版本为 2016 年 6 月 21 日公布的 9.0.0。\nUnicode 标准使用十六进制数字，而且在数字前面加上前缀 U+，比如，大写字母「A」的 unicode 编码为 U+0041，汉字「严」的 unicode 编码为 U+4E25。更多的符号对应表，可以查询 unicode.org，或者专门的汉字对应表。\nUTF-8\nUnicode 看起来已经很完美了，实现了大一统。但是，Unicode 却存在一个很大的问题：资源浪费。\n为什么这么说呢？原来，Unicode 为了能表示世界各国所有文字，一开始用两个字节，后来发现两个字节不够用，又用了四个字节。比如，汉字「严」的 unicode 编码是十六进制数 4E25，转换成二进制有十五位，即 100111000100101，因此至少需要两个字节才能表示这个汉字，但是对于其他的字符，就可能需要三个或四个字节，甚至更多。\n这时，问题就来了，如果以前的 ASCII 字符集也用这种方式来表示，那岂不是很浪费存储空间。比如，大写字母「A」的二进制编码为 01000001，它只需要一个字节就够了，如果 unicode 统一使用三个字节或四个字节来表示字符，那「A」的二进制编码的前面几个字节就都是 0，这是很浪费存储空间的。\n为了解决这个问题，在 Unicode 的基础上，人们实现了 UTF-16, UTF-32 和 UTF-8。下面只说一下 UTF-8。\nUTF-8 (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format) 是一种针对 Unicode 的可变长度字符编码，它使用一到四个字节来表示字符，例如，ASCII 字符继续使用一个字节编码，阿拉伯文、希腊文等使用两个字节编码，常用汉字使用三个字节编码，等等。\n因此，我们说，UTF-8 是 Unicode 的实现方式之一，其他实现方式还包括 UTF-16（字符用两个或四个字节表示）和 UTF-32（字符用四个字节表示）。\nPython 的默认编码\nPython2 的默认编码是 ascii，Python3 的默认编码是 utf-8，可以通过下面的方式获取：\n\nPython2\n\nPython 2.7.11 (default, Feb 24 2016, 10:48:05)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)] on darwin\nType &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;,

information.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getdefaultencoding()\n&#39;utf-8&#39;\n\nPython2 中的字符类型\nPython2 中有两种和字符串相关的类型：str 和 unicode，它们的父类是 basestring。其中，str 类型的字符串有多种编码方式，默认是 ascii，还有 gbk，utf-8 等，unicode 类型的字符串使用 u&#39;...&#39; 的形式来表示，下面的图展示了 str 和 unicode 之间的关系：\n\n两种字符串的相互转换概括如下：\n\n把 UTF-8 编码表示的字符串 &#39;xxx&#39; 转换为 Unicode 字符串 u&#39;xxx&#39; 用 decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;) 方法：\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;中文&#39;.decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)\nu&#39;\\u4e2d\\u6587&#39;\n\n\n把 u&#39;xxx&#39; 转换为 UTF-8 编码的 &#39;xxx&#39; 用 encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;) 方法：\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; u&#39;中文&#39;.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)\n&#39;\\xe4\\xb8\\xad\\xe6\\x96\\x87&#39;\n\nUnicodeEncodeError &amp; UnicodeDecodeError 根源\n用 Python2 编写程序的时候经常会遇到 UnicodeEncodeError 和 UnicodeDecodeError，它们出现的根源就是如果代码里面混合使用了 str 类型和 unicode 类型的字符串，Python 会默认使用 ascii 编码尝试对 unicode 类型的字符串编码 (encode)，或对 str 类型的字符串解码 (decode)，这时就很可能出现上述错误。\n下面有两个常见的场景，我们最好牢牢记住：\n\n在进行同时包含 str 类型和 unicode 类型的字符串操作时，Python2 一律都把 str 解码（decode）成 unicode 再运算，这时就很容易出现 UnicodeDecodeError。\n\n让我们看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;你好&#39;    # str 类型, utf-8 编码\n&gt;&gt;&gt; u = u&#39;世界&#39;   # unicode 类型\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s + u        # 会进行隐式转换，即 s.decode(&#39;ascii&#39;) + u\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nUnicodeDecodeError: &#39;ascii&#39; codec can&#39;t decode byte 0xe4 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)\n\n为了避免出错，我们就需要显示指定使用 &#39;utf-8&#39; 进行解码，如下：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;你好&#39;                 # str 类型，utf-8 编码\n&gt;&gt;&gt; u = u&#39;世界&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;) + u     # 显示指定 &#39;utf-8&#39; 进行转换\nu&#39;\\u4f60\\u597d\\u4e16\\u754c&#39;   # 注意这不是错误，这是 unicode 字符串\n\n如果函数或类等对象接收的是 str 类型的字符串，但你传的是 unicode，Python2 会默认使用 ascii 将其编码成 str 类型再运算，这时就很容易出现 UnicodeEncodeError。\n\n让我们看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; u_str = u&#39;你好&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; str(u_str)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nUnicodeEncodeError: &#39;ascii&#39; codec can&#39;t encode characters in position 0-1: ordinal not in range(128)\n\n在上面的代码中，u_str 是一个 unicode 类型的字符串，由于 str() 的参数只能是 str 类型，此时 Python 会试图使用 ascii 将其编码成 ascii，也就是：\nu_str.encode(&#39;ascii&#39;)   // u_str 是 unicode 字符串\n上面将 unicode 类型的中文使用 ascii 编码转，肯定会出错。\n再看一个使用 raw_input 的例子，注意 raw_input 只接收 str 类型的字符串：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input(&#39;input your name: &#39;)\ninput your name: ethan\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name\n&#39;ethan&#39;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input(&#39;输入你的姓名：&#39;)\n输入你的姓名： 小明\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name\n&#39;\\xe5\\xb0\\x8f\\xe6\\x98\\x8e&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(name)\n&lt;type &#39;str&#39;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input(u&#39;输入你的姓名: &#39;)   # 会试图使用 u&#39;输入你的姓名&#39;.encode(&#39;ascii&#39;)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nUnicodeEncodeError: &#39;ascii&#39; codec can&#39;t encode characters in position 0-5: ordinal not in range(128)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input(u&#39;输入你的姓名: &#39;.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)) #可以，但此时 name 不是 unicode 类型\n输入你的姓名: 小明\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name\n&#39;\\xe5\\xb0\\x8f\\xe6\\x98\\x8e&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(name)\n&lt;type &#39;str&#39;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input(u&#39;输入你的姓名: &#39;.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)).decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;) # 推荐\n输入你的姓名:  小明\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name\nu&#39;\\u5c0f\\u660e&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(name)\n&lt;type &#39;unicode&#39;&gt;\n\n再看一个重定向的例子：\nhello = u&#39;你好&#39;\nprint hello\n\n将上面的代码保存到文件 hello.py，在终端执行 python hello.py 可以正常打印，但是如果将其重定向到文件 python hello.py &gt; result 会发现 UnicodeEncodeError。\n这是因为：输出到控制台时，print 使用的是控制台的默认编码，而重定向到文件时，print 就不知道使用什么编码了，于是就使用了默认编码 ascii 导致出现编码错误。\n应该改成如下:\nhello = u&#39;你好&#39;\nprint hello.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)\n\n这样执行 python hello.py &gt; result 就没有问题。\n小结\n\nUTF-8 是一种针对 Unicode 的可变长度字符编码，它是 Unicode 的实现方式之一。\nUnicode 字符集有多种编码标准，比如 UTF-8, UTF-7, UTF-16。\n在进行同时包含 str 类型和 unicode 类型的字符串操作时，Python2 一律都把 str 解码（decode）成 unicode 再运算。\n如果函数或类等对象接收的是 str 类型的字符串，但你传的是 unicode，Python2 会默认使用 ascii 将其编码成 str 类型再运算。\n\n参考资料\n\n字符 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书\nUTF-8 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书\n字符，字节和编码 - Characters, Bytes And Encoding\n字符编码笔记：ASCII，Unicode和UTF-8 - 阮一峰的网络日志\n字符串和编码 - 廖雪峰的官方网站\npython - Dangers of

Python3 中发生了一些改变，raw_input 已经没有了，input 的用法发生了变化，print 也从原来的语句变成了一个函数。本文将对这两种情况进行介绍。\n输入\n\n首先看 Python2 中的 raw_input，它的用法如下：\n\nraw_input(prompt)\n其中，prompt 表示输入提示。raw_input 会读取控制台的输入，并返回字符串类型。\n让我们看几个例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input(&#39;please enter your name: &#39;)\nplease enter your name: ethan     # 输入一个字符串\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name\n&#39;ethan&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(name)\n&lt;type &#39;str&#39;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; num = raw_input(&#39;please enter your id: &#39;)\nplease enter your id: 12345       # 输入一个数值\n&gt;&gt;&gt; num\n&#39;12345&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(num)\n&lt;type &#39;str&#39;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sum = raw_input(&#39;please enter a+b: &#39;)\nplease enter a+b: 3+6             # 输入一个表达式\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sum\n&#39;3+6&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(sum)\n&lt;type &#39;str&#39;&gt;\n\n可以看到，不管我们输入一个字符串、数值还是表达式，raw_input 都直接返回一个字符串。\n\n现在看一下 Pythn2 中的 input。\n\ninput 的用法跟 raw_input 类似，形式如下：\ninput(prompt)\n\n事实上，input 本质上是使用 raw_input 实现的，如下：\ndef input(prompt):\n    return (eval(raw_input(prompt)))\n\n也就是说，调用 input 实际上是通过调用 raw_input 再调用 eval 函数实现的。\n这里的 eval 通常用来执行一个字符串表达式，并返回表达式的值，它的基本用法如下：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(&#39;1+2&#39;)\n3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(&#39;a+9&#39;)\n10\n现在，让我们看看 input 的用法：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = input(&#39;please input your name: &#39;)\nplease input your name: ethan         # 输入字符串如果没加引号会出错\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n  File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nNameError: name &#39;ethan&#39; is not defined\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = input(&#39;please input your name: &#39;)\nplease input your name: &#39;ethan&#39;       # 添加引号\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name\n&#39;ethan&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; num = input(&#39;please input your id: &#39;)\nplease input your id: 12345           # 输入数值\n&gt;&gt;&gt; num                               # 注意返回的是数值类型，而不是字符串\n12345\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(num)\n&lt;type &#39;int&#39;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sum = input(&#39;please enter a+b: &#39;)  # 输入数字表达式，会对表达式求值\nplease enter a+b: 3+6\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sum\n9\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(sum)\n&lt;type &#39;int&#39;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sum = input(&#39;please enter a+b: &#39;)   # 输入字符串表达式，会字符串进行运算\nplease enter a+b: &#39;3&#39;+&#39;6&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sum\n&#39;36&#39;\n\n可以看到，使用 input 的时候，如果输入的是字符串，必须使用引号把它们括起来；如果输入的是数值类型，则返回的也是数值类型；如果输入的是表达式，会对表达式进行运算。\n\n再来看一下 Python3 中的 input。\n\n事实上，Python3 中的 input 就是 Python2 中的 raw_input，也就是说，原 Python2 中的 raw_input 被重命名为 input 了。那如果我们想使用原 Python2 的 input 功能呢？你可以这样做：\neval(input())\n\n也就是说，手动添加 eval 函数。\n输出\nPython2 中的 print 是一个语句（statement），而 Python3 中的 print 是一个函数。\nPython2 中的 print\n\n简单输出\n\n使用 print 最简单的方式就是直接在 print 后面加上数字、字符串、列表等对象，比如：\n# Python 2.7.11 (default, Feb 24 2016, 10:48:05)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print 123\n123\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &#39;abc&#39;\nabc\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 10\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print x\n10\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print d\n{&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2}\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(123)\n123\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;abc&#39;)\nabc\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x)\n10\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(d)\n{&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2}\n\n在 Python2 中，使用 print 时可以加括号，也可以不加括号。\n\n格式化输出\n\n有时，我们需要对输出进行一些格式化，比如限制小数的精度等，直接看几个例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;hello&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l = len(s)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;the length of %s is %d&#39; % (s, l))\nthe length of hello is 5\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pi = 3.14159\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;%10.3f&#39; % pi)     # 字段宽度 10，精度 3\n     3.142\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;%010.3f&#39; % pi)    # 用 0 填充空白\n000003.142\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;%+f&#39; % pi)        # 显示正负号\n+3.141590\n\n换行输出\n\nprint 默认是换行输出的，如果不想换行，可以在末尾加上一个 `,&#39;，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0, 3):\n...     print i\n...\n0\n1\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0, 3):\n...     print i,           # 加了 ,\n...\n0 1 2                      # 注意会加上一个空格\n\nPython3 中的 print\n在 Python3 中使用 print 跟 Python2 差别不大，不过要注意的是在 Python3 中使用 print 必须加括号，否则会抛出 SyntaxError。\n另外，如果不想 print 换行输出，可以参考下面的方式：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0, 3):\n...     print(i)\n...\n0\n1\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0, 3):\n...     print(i, end=&#39;&#39;)    # 加上一个 end 参数\n...\n012\n\n小结\n\n在 Python2 中，raw_input 会读取控制台的输入，并返回字符串类型。\n在 Python2 中，如无特殊要求建议使用 raw_input() 来与用户交互。\n在 Python3 中，使用 input 处理输入，如有特殊要求，可以考虑加上 eval。\n\n参考资料\n\npython - What&#39;s the difference between raw_input() and input() in python3.x? - Stack Overflow\n\n"},"Datatypes/":{"url":"Datatypes/","title":"常用数据类型","body":"常用数据类型\n在介绍 Python 的常用数据类型之前，我们先看看 Python 最基本的数据结构 - 序列（sequence）。\n序列的一个特点就是根据索引（index，即元素的位置）来获取序列中的元素，第一个索引是 0，第二个索引是 1，以此类推。\n所有序列类型都可以进行某些通用的操作，比如：\n\n索引（indexing）\n分片（sliceing）\n迭代（iteration）\n加（adding）\n乘（multiplying）\n\n除了上面这些，我们还可以检查某个元素是否属于序列的成员，计算序列的长度等等。\n说完序列，我们接下来看看 Python 中常用的数据类型，如下：\n\n列表（list）\n元组（tuple）\n字符串（string）\n字典（dict）\n集合（set）\n\n其中，列表、元组和字符串都属于序列类型，它们可以进行某些通用的操作，比如索引、分片等；字典属于映射类型，每个元素由键（key）和值（value）构成；集合是一种特殊的类型，它所包含的元素是不重复的。\n通用的序列操作\n索引\n序列中的元素可以通过索引获取，索引从 0 开始。看看下面的例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]   # 列表\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums[0]\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums[1]\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums[-1]                 # 索引 -1 表示最后一个元素\n5\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;abcdef&#39;             # 字符串\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s[0]\n&#39;a&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s[1]\n&#39;b&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = (1, 2, 3)            # 元组\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0]\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1]\n2\n注意到，-1 则代表序列的最后一个元素，-2 代表倒数第二个元素，以此类推。\n分片\n索引用于获取序列中的单个元素，而分片则用于获取序列的部分元素。分片操作需要提供两个索引作为边界，中间用冒号相隔，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[0:2]                   # 列表分片\n[1, 2]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[2:5]\n[3, 4, 5]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;hello, world&#39;             # 字符串分片\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s[0:5]\n&#39;hello&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)           # 元组分片\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2:4]\n(6, 8)\n\n这里需要特别注意的是，分片有两个索引，第 1 个索引的元素是包含在内的，而第 2 个元素的索引则不包含在内，也就是说，numbers[2:5] 获取的是 numbers[2], numbers[3], numbers[4]，没有包括 numbers[5]。\n下面列举使用分片的一些技巧。\n\n访问最后几个元素\n\n假设需要访问序列的最后 3 个元素，我们当然可以像下面这样做：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[3:6]\n[4, 5, 6]\n\n有没有更简洁的方法呢？想到可以使用负数形式的索引，你可能会尝试这样做：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[-3:-1]      # 实际取出的是 numbers[-3], numbers[-2]\n[4, 5]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[-3:0]       # 左边索引的元素比右边索引出现得晚，返回空序列\n[]\n\n上面的两种使用方式并不能正确获取序列的最后 3 个元素，Python 提供了一个捷径：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[-3:]\n[6, 7, 8]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[5:]\n[6, 7, 8]\n\n也就是说，如果希望分片包含最后一个元素，可将第 2 个索引置为空。\n如果要复制整个序列，可以将两个索引都置为空：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = numbers[:]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n\n使用步长\n\n使用分片的时候，步长默认是 1，即逐个访问，我们也可以自定义步长，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[0:4]\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[0:4:1]    # 步长为 1，不写也可以，默认为 1\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[0:4:2]    # 步长为 2，取出 numbers[0], numbers[2]\n[1, 3]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[::3]      # 等价于 numbers[0:8:3]，取出索引为 0, 3, 6 的元素\n[1, 4, 7]\n\n另外，步长也可以是负数，表示从右到左取元素：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[0:4:-1]\n[]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[4:0:-1]       # 取出索引为 4, 3, 2, 1 的元素\n[5, 4, 3, 2]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[4:0:-2]       # 取出索引为 4, 2 的元素\n[5, 3]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[::-1]         # 从右到左取出所有元素\n[8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[::-2]         # 取出索引为 7, 5, 3, 1 的元素\n[8, 6, 4, 2]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[6::-2]        # 取出索引为 6, 4, 2, 0 的元素\n[7, 5, 3, 1]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[:6:-2]        # 取出索引为 7 的元素\n[8]\n\n这里总结一下使用分片操作的一些方法，分片的使用形式是：\n# 左索引:右索引:步长\nleft_index:right_index:step\n\n要牢牢记住的是：\n\n左边索引的元素包括在结果之中，右边索引的元素不包括在结果之中；\n当使用一个负数作为步长时，必须让左边索引大于右边索引；\n对正数步长，从左向右取元素；对负数步长，从右向左取元素；\n\n加\n序列可以进行「加法」操作，如下：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]     # 「加法」效果其实就是连接在一起\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6)\n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;hello, &#39; + &#39;world!&#39;\n&#39;hello, world!&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3] + &#39;abc&#39;\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nTypeError: can only concatenate list (not &quot;str&quot;) to list\n\n这里需要注意的是：两种相同类型的序列才能「加法」操作。\n乘\n序列可以进行「乘法」操作，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;abc&#39; * 3\n&#39;abcabcabc&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [0] * 3\n[0, 0, 0]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3] * 3\n[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\nin\n为了检查一个值是否在序列中，可以使用 in 运算符，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;he&#39; in &#39;hello&#39;\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;hl&#39; in &#39;hello&#39;\nFalse\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 in [6, 8, 10]\nTrue\n\n参考资料\n\n《Python

方法用于将某个元素添加到某个位置。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers.insert(3, 9)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers\n[1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 5, 6]\n\npop\npop

list.remove(x): x not in list\n\nreverse\nreverse 方法用于将列表中的元素进行反转。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 5, 8]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers.reverse()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers\n[8, 5, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1]\n\nsort\nsort 方法用于对列表进行排序，注意该方法会改变原来的列表，而不是返回新的排序列表，另外，sort 方法的返回值是空。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [4, 3, 6, 8, 9, 1]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a.sort()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b == None         # 返回值为空\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9]    # 原列表已经发生改变\n\n如果我们不想改变原列表，而是希望返回一个排序后的列表，可以使用 sorted 函数，如下：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [4, 3, 6, 8, 9, 1]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = sorted(a)          # 返回一个排序后的列表\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[4, 3, 6, 8, 9, 1]         # 原列表没有改变\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b\n[1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9]         # 这是对原列表排序后的列表\n\n注意到，不管是 sort 方法还是 sorted 函数，默认排序都是升序排序。如果你想要降序排序，就需要指定排序参数了。比如，对 sort 方法，可以添加一个 reverse 关键字参数，如下：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [4, 3, 6, 8, 9, 1]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.sort(reverse=True)    # 反向排序\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[9, 8, 6, 4, 3, 1]\n\n该参数对 sorted 函数同样适用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [4, 3, 6, 8, 9, 1]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(a, reverse=True)\n[9, 8, 6, 4, 3, 1]\n\n除了 reverse 关键字参数，还可以指定 key 关键字参数，它为每个元素创建一个键，然后所有元素按照这个键来排序，比如我们想根据元素的长度来排序：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = [&#39;ccc&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;bb&#39;, &#39;dddd&#39;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.sort(key=len)          # 使用 len 作为键函数，根据元素长度排序\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s\n[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;bb&#39;, &#39;ccc&#39;, &#39;dddd&#39;]\n\n另外，我们还可以使用 sorted 进行多列（属性）排序。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; students = [\n        (&#39;john&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, 15),\n        (&#39;jane&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, 12),\n        (&#39;dave&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, 10),\n

方法只处理单个字符。\ntranslate 方法的使用形式如下：\nstr.translate(table[, deletechars]);\n\n其中，table 是一个包含 256 个字符的转换表，可通过 maketrans 方法转换而来，deletechars 是字符串中要过滤的字符集。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from string import maketrans\n&gt;&gt;&gt; table = maketrans(&#39;aeiou&#39;, &#39;12345&#39;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; motto = &#39;to be or not to be, that is a question&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; motto.translate(table)\n&#39;t4 b2 4r n4t t4 b2, th1t 3s 1 q52st34n&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; motto\n&#39;to be or not to be, that is a question&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; motto.translate(table, &#39;rqu&#39;)        # 移除所有的 &#39;r&#39;, &#39;q&#39;, &#39;u&#39;\n&#39;t4 b2 4 n4t t4 b2, th1t 3s 1 2st34n&#39;\n\n可以看到，maketrans 接收两个参数：两个等长的字符串，表示第一个字符串的每个字符用第二个字符串对应位置的字符替代，在上面的例子中，就是 &#39;a&#39; 用 &#39;1&#39; 替代，&#39;e&#39; 用 &#39;2&#39; 替代，等等，注意，是单个字符的代替，而不是整个字符串的替代。因此，motto 中的 o 都被替换为 4，e 都被替换为 2，等等。\nlower/upper\nlower/upper 用于返回字符串的大写或小写形式。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x = &#39;PYTHON&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x.lower()\n&#39;python&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x\n&#39;PYTHON&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; y = &#39;python&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; y.upper()\n&#39;PYTHON&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; y\n&#39;python&#39;\n\n小结\n\n字符串是不可变对象，调用对象自身的任意方法，也不会改变该对象自身的内容。相反，这些方法会创建新的对象并返回。\ntranslate 针对单个字符进行替换。\n\n参考资料\n\n《python

d0\n{}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{&#39;age&#39;: 20, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1[&#39;age&#39;] = 21          # 更新字典\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{&#39;age&#39;: 21, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = dict(name=&#39;ethan&#39;, age=20)    # 使用 dict 函数\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{&#39;age&#39;: 20, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; item = [(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;ethan&#39;), (&#39;age&#39;, 20)]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d3 = dict(item)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d3\n{&#39;age&#39;: 20, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n\n遍历字典\n遍历字典有多种方式，这里先介绍一些基本的方式，后文会介绍一些高效的遍历方式。\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for key in d:\n...     print &#39;%s: %s&#39; % (key, d[key])\n...\nage: 20\nname: ethan\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d[&#39;name&#39;]\n&#39;ethan&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d[&#39;age&#39;]\n20\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for key in d:\n...     if key == &#39;name&#39;:\n...         del d[key]         # 要删除字典的某一项\n...\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nRuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for key in d.keys():  # python2 应该使用这种方式, python3 使用 list(d.keys())\n...     if key == &#39;name&#39;:\n...         del d[key]\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;age&#39;: 20}\n\n在上面，我们介绍了两种遍历方式：for key in d 和 for key in d.keys()，如果在遍历的时候，要删除键为 key 的某项，使用第一种方式会抛出 RuntimeError，使用第二种方式则不会。\n判断键是否在字典里面\n有时，我们需要判断某个键是否在字典里面，这时可以用 in 进行判断，如下：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;name&#39; in d\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d[&#39;score&#39;]             # 访问不存在的键，会抛出 KeyError\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nKeyError: &#39;score&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;score&#39; in d           # 使用 in 判断 key 是否在字典里面\nFalse\n\n字典常用方法\n字典有自己的一些操作方法，这里只介绍部分常用的方法：\n\nclear\ncopy\nget\nsetdefault\nupdate\npop\npopitem\nkeys/iterkeys\nvalues/itervalues\nitems/iteritems\nfromkeys\n\nclear\nclear 方法用于清空字典中的所有项，这是个原地操作，所以无返回值（或者说是 None）。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; rv = d.clear()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print rv\nNone\n\n再看看一个例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = {}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = d1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2[&#39;name&#39;] = &#39;ethan&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = {}         # d1 变为空字典\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}   # d2 不受影响\n\n在上面，d1 和 d2 最初对应同一个字典，而后我们使用 d1 = {} 使其变成一个空字典，但此时 d2 不受影响。如果希望 d1 变成空字典之后，d2 也变成空字典，则可以使用 clear 方法：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = {}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = d1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2[&#39;name&#39;] = &#39;ethan&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1.clear()      # d1 清空之后，d2 也为空\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{}\n\ncopy\ncopy 方法实现的是浅复制（shallow copy）。它具有以下特点：\n\n对可变对象的修改保持同步；\n对不可变对象的修改保持独立；\n\n看看例子：\n# name 的值是不可变对象，books 的值是可变对象\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book2&#39;, &#39;book3&#39;]}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = d1.copy()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2[&#39;name&#39;] = &#39;peter&#39;         # d2 对不可变对象的修改不会改变 d1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book2&#39;, &#39;book3&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;peter&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book2&#39;, &#39;book3&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2[&#39;books&#39;].remove(&#39;book2&#39;)  # d2 对可变对象的修改会影响 d1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book3&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;peter&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book3&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1[&#39;books&#39;].remove(&#39;book3&#39;)  # d1 对可变对象的修改会影响 d2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;peter&#39;}\n\n和浅复制对应的是深复制（deep copy），它会创造出一个副本，跟原来的对象没有关系，可以通过 copy 模块的 deepcopy 函数来实现：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from copy import deepcopy\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book2&#39;, &#39;book3&#39;]}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = deepcopy(d1)              # 创造出一个副本\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2[&#39;books&#39;].remove(&#39;book2&#39;)    # 对 d2 的任何修改不会影响到 d1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book3&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book2&#39;, &#39;book3&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1[&#39;books&#39;].remove(&#39;book3&#39;)    # 对 d1 的任何修改也不会影响到 d2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book2&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2\n{&#39;books&#39;: [&#39;book1&#39;, &#39;book3&#39;], &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n\nget\n当我们试图访问字典中不存在的项时会出现 KeyError，但使用 get 就可以避免这个问题。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d[&#39;name&#39;]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nKeyError: &#39;name&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print d.get(&#39;name&#39;)\nNone\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.get(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;ethan&#39;)   # &#39;name&#39; 不存在，使用默认值 &#39;ethan&#39;\n&#39;ethan&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{}\n\nsetdefault\nsetdefault 方法用于对字典设定键值。使用形式如下：\ndict.setdefault(key, default=None)\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.setdefault(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;ethan&#39;)   # 返回设定的默认值 &#39;ethan&#39;\n&#39;ethan&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d                               # d 被更新\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d[&#39;age&#39;] = 20\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;age&#39;: 20, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.setdefault(&#39;age&#39;, 18)         # age 已存在，返回已有的值，不会更新字典\n20\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;age&#39;: 20, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n\n可以看到，当键不存在的时候，setdefault 返回设定的默认值并且更新字典。当键存在的时候，会返回已有的值，但不会更新字典。\nupdate\nupdate 方法用于将一个字典添加到原字典，如果存在相同的键则会进行覆盖。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update(d1)               # 将字典 d1 添加到 d\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = {&#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update(d2)               # 将字典 d2 添加到 d\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;age&#39;: 20, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d3 = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;michael&#39;}   # 将字典 d3 添加到 d，存在相同的 key，则覆盖\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update(d3)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;age&#39;: 20, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;michael&#39;}\n\nitems/iteritems\nitems 方法将所有的字典项以列表形式返回，这些列表项的每一项都来自于（键，值）。我们也经常使用这个方法来对字典进行遍历。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.items()\n[(&#39;age&#39;, 20), (&#39;name&#39;, &#39;ethan&#39;)]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for k, v in d.items():\n...     print &#39;%s: %s&#39; % (k, v)\n...\nage: 20\nname: ethan\n\niteritems 的作用大致相同，但会返回一个迭代器对象而不是列表，同样，我们也可以使用这个方法来对字典进行遍历，而且这也是推荐的做法：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.iteritems()\n&lt;dictionary-itemiterator object at 0x109cf2d60&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for k, v in d.iteritems():\n...     print &#39;%s: %s&#39; % (k, v)\n...\nage: 20\nname: ethan\n\nkeys/iterkeys\nkeys 方法将字典的键以列表形式返回，iterkeys 则返回针对键的迭代器。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.keys()\n[&#39;age&#39;, &#39;name&#39;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.iterkeys()\n&lt;dictionary-keyiterator object at 0x1077fad08&gt;\n\nvalues/itervalues\nvalues 方法将字典的值以列表形式返回，itervalues 则返回针对值的迭代器。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.values()\n[20, &#39;ethan&#39;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.itervalues()\n&lt;dictionary-valueiterator object at 0x10477dd08&gt;\n\npop\npop 方法用于将某个键值对从字典移除，并返回给定键的值。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.pop(&#39;name&#39;)\n&#39;ethan&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;age&#39;: 20}\n\npopitem\npopitem 用于随机移除字典中的某个键值对。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;id&#39;: 10, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.popitem()\n(&#39;age&#39;, 20)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;id&#39;: 10, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.popitem()\n(&#39;id&#39;, 10)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;}\n\n对元素为字典的列表排序\n事实上，我们很少直接对字典进行排序，而是对元素为字典的列表进行排序。\n比如，存在下面的 students 列表，它的元素是字典：\nstudents = [\n    {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;john&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;B&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 15},\n    {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;jane&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;A&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 12},\n    {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;dave&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;B&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 10},\n    {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;C&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20},\n    {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;peter&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;B&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 20},\n    {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;mike&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;C&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16}\n]\n\n\n按 score 从小到大排序\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(students, key=lambda stu: stu[&#39;score&#39;])\n[{&#39;age&#39;: 12, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;jane&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;A&#39;},\n {&#39;age&#39;: 15, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;john&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;B&#39;},\n {&#39;age&#39;: 10, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;dave&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;B&#39;},\n {&#39;age&#39;: 20, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;peter&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;B&#39;},\n {&#39;age&#39;: 20, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;C&#39;},\n {&#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;mike&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: &#39;C&#39;}]\n\n需要注意的是，这里是按照字母的 ascii 大小排序的，所以 score 从小到大，即从 &#39;A&#39; 到 &#39;C&#39;。\n\n按 score

中，定义函数和调用函数都很简单，但如何定义函数参数和传递函数参数，则涉及到一些套路了。总的来说，Python 的函数参数主要分为以下几种：\n\n必选参数\n默认参数\n可变参数\n关键字参数\n\n必选参数\n必选参数可以说是最常见的了，顾名思义，必选参数就是在调用函数的时候要传入数量一致的参数，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(x, y):        # x, y 是必选参数\n...     print x + y\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add()                 # 啥都没传，不行\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nTypeError: add() takes exactly 2 arguments (0 given)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(1)                # 只传了一个，也不行\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nTypeError: add() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(1, 2)             # 数量一致，通过\n3\n\n默认参数\n默认参数是指在定义函数的时候提供一些默认值，如果在调用函数的时候没有传递该参数，则自动使用默认值，否则使用传递时该参数的值。\n看看例子就明白了：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(x, y, z=1):     # x, y 是必选参数，z 是默认参数，默认值是 1\n...     print x + y + z\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(1, 2, 3)            # 1+2+3\n6\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(1, 2)               # 没有传递 z，自动使用 z=1，即 1+2+1\n4\n\n可以看到，默认参数使用起来也很简单，但有两点需要注意的是：\n\n默认参数要放在所有必选参数的后面\n默认参数应该使用不可变对象\n\n比如，下面对默认参数的使用是错误的：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(x=1, y, z):      # x 是默认参数，必须放在所有必选参数的后面\n...     return x + y + z\n...\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1\nSyntaxError: non-default argument follows default argument\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(x, y=1, z):      # y 是默认参数，必须放在所有必选参数的后面\n...     return x + y + z\n...\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1\nSyntaxError: non-default argument follows default argument\n\n再来看看为什么默认参数应该使用不可变对象。\n我们看一个例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add_to_list(L=[]):\n...     L.append(&#39;END&#39;)\n...     return L\n\n在上面的函数中，L 是一个默认参数，默认值是 []，表示空列表。\n我们来看看使用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add_to_list([1, 2, 3])          # 没啥问题\n[1, 2, 3, &#39;END&#39;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add_to_list([&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;])    # 没啥问题\n[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;END&#39;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add_to_list()                   # 没有传递参数，使用默认值，也没啥问题\n[&#39;END&#39;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add_to_list()                   # 没有传递参数，使用默认值，竟出现两个 &#39;END&#39;\n[&#39;END&#39;, &#39;END&#39;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add_to_list()                   # 糟糕了，三个 &#39;END&#39;\n[&#39;END&#39;, &#39;END&#39;, &#39;END&#39;]\n\n为啥呢？我们在调用函数的时候没有传递参数，那么就默认使用 L=[]，经过处理，L 应该只有一个元素，怎么会出现调用函数两次，L 就有两个元素呢？\n原来，L 指向了可变对象 []，当你调用函数时，L 的内容发生了改变，默认参数的内容也会跟着变，也就是，当你第一次调用时，L 的初始值是 []，当你第二次调用时，L 的初始值是 [&#39;END&#39;]，等等。\n所以，为了避免不必要的错误，我们应该使用不可变对象作为函数的默认参数。\n可变参数\n在某些情况下，我们在定义函数的时候，无法预估函数应该制定多少个参数，这时我们就可以使用可变参数了，也就是，函数的参数个数是不确定的。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(*numbers):\n...     sum = 0\n...     for i in numbers:\n...         sum += i\n...     print &#39;numbers:&#39;, numbers\n...     return sum\n\n在上面的代码中，numbers 就是一个可变参数，参数前面有一个 * 号，表示是可变的。在函数内部，参数 numbers 接收到的是一个 tuple。\n在调用函数时，我们可以给该函数传递任意个参数，包括 0 个参数：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add()           # 传递 0 个参数\nnumbers: ()\n0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(1)          # 传递 1 个参数\nnumbers: (1,)\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(1, 2)       # 传递 2 个参数\nnumbers: (1, 2)\n3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(1, 2, 3)    # 传递 3 个参数\nnumbers: (1, 2, 3)\n6\n\n上面的 * 表示任意参数，实际上，它还有另外一个用法：用来给函数传递参数。\n看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(x, y, z):        # 有 3 个必选参数\n...     return x + y + z\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(a[0], a[1], a[2])    # 这样传递参数很累赘\n6\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(*a)                  # 使用 *a，相当于上面的做法\n6\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = (4, 5, 6)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(*b)                  # 对元组一样适用\n15\n\n再看一个例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(*numbers):       # 函数参数是可变参数\n...     sum = 0\n...     for i in numbers:\n...         sum += i\n...     return sum\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(*a)                  # 使用 *a 给函数传递参数\n3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(*a)\n10\n\n关键字参数\n可变参数允许你将不定数量的参数传递给函数，而关键字参数则允许你将不定长度的键值对, 作为参数传递给一个函数。\n让我们看看例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(**kwargs):\n    return kwargs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add()            # 没有参数，kwargs 为空字典\n{}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(x=1)         # x=1 =&gt; kwargs={&#39;x&#39;: 1}\n{&#39;x&#39;: 1}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(x=1, y=2)    # x=1, y=2 =&gt; kwargs={&#39;y&#39;: 2, &#39;x&#39;: 1}\n{&#39;y&#39;: 2, &#39;x&#39;: 1}\n\n在上面的代码中，kwargs 就是一个关键字参数，它前面有两个 * 号。kwargs 可以接收不定长度的键值对，在函数内部，它会表示成一个 dict。\n和可变参数类似，我们也可以使用 **kwargs 的形式来调用函数，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(x, y, z):\n...     return x + y + z\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dict1 = {&#39;z&#39;: 3, &#39;x&#39;: 1, &#39;y&#39;: 6}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(dict1[&#39;x&#39;], dict1[&#39;y&#39;], dict1[&#39;z&#39;])    # 这样传参很累赘\n10\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add(**dict1)        # 使用 **dict1 来传参，等价于上面的做法\n10\n\n再看一个例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def sum(**kwargs):               # 函数参数是关键字参数\n...     sum = 0\n...     for k, v in kwargs.items():\n...         sum += v\n...     return sum\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sum()                            # 没有参数\n0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dict1 = {&#39;x&#39;: 1}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(**dict1)                     # 相当于 sum(x=1)\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dict2 = {&#39;x&#39;: 2, &#39;y&#39;: 6} \n&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(**dict2)                     # 相当于 sum(x=2, y=6)\n8\n\n参数组合\n在实际的使用中，我们经常会同时用到必选参数、默认参数、可变参数和关键字参数或其中的某些。但是，需要注意的是，它们在使用的时候是有顺序的，依次是必选参数、默认参数、可变参数和关键字参数。\n比如，定义一个包含上述四种参数的函数：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(x, y, z=0, *args, **kwargs):\n    print &#39;x =&#39;, x\n    print &#39;y =&#39;, y\n    print &#39;z =&#39;, z\n    print &#39;args =&#39;, args\n    print &#39;kwargs =&#39;, kwargs\n\n在调用函数的时候，Python 会自动按照参数位置和参数名把对应的参数传进去。让我们看看：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; func(1, 2)                     # 至少提供两个参数，因为 x, y 是必选参数\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 0\nargs = ()\nkwargs = {}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; func(1, 2, 3)                  # x=1, y=2, z=3\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3\nargs = ()\nkwargs = {}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; func(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)         # x=1, y=2, z=3, args=(4, 5, 6), kwargs={}\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3\nargs = (4, 5, 6)\nkwargs = {}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; func(1, 2, 4, u=6, v=7)        # args = (), kwargs = {&#39;u&#39;: 6, &#39;v&#39;: 7}\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 4\nargs = ()\nkwargs = {&#39;u&#39;: 6, &#39;v&#39;: 7}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; func(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, u=6, v=7)   # args = (4, 5), kwargs = {&#39;u&#39;: 6, &#39;v&#39;: 7}\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3\nargs = (4, 5)\nkwargs = {&#39;u&#39;: 6, &#39;v&#39;: 7}\n\n我们还可以通过下面的形式来传递参数：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = (1, 2, 3)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = {&#39;u&#39;: 6, &#39;v&#39;: 7}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; func(*a, **b)\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3\nargs = ()\nkwargs = {&#39;u&#39;: 6, &#39;v&#39;: 7}\n\n小结\n\n默认参数要放在所有必选参数的后面。\n应该使用不可变对象作为函数的默认参数。\n*args 表示可变参数，**kwargs 表示关键字参数。\n参数组合在使用的时候是有顺序的，依次是必选参数、默认参数、可变参数和关键字参数。\n*args 和 **kwargs 是 Python 的惯用写法。\n\n参考资料\n\nargs 和 *kwargs · Python进阶\n函数的参数 - 廖雪峰的官方网站\n\n"},"Functional/":{"url":"Functional/","title":"函数式编程","body":"函数式编程\n函数式编程（functional programming）是一种编程范式（Programming paradigm），或者说编程模式，比如我们常见的过程式编程是一种编程范式，面向对象编程又是另一种编程范式。\n函数式编程的一大特性就是：可以把函数当成变量来使用，比如将函数赋值给其他变量、把函数作为参数传递给其他函数、函数的返回值也可以是一个函数等等。\nPython 不是纯函数式编程语言，但它对函数式编程提供了一些支持。本章主要介绍 Python 中的函数式编程，主要包括以下几个方面：\n\n高阶函数\n匿名函数\nmap/reduce/filter\n闭包\n装饰器\npartial 函数\n\n参考资料\n\n什么是函数式编程思维？ - 知乎\n编程范型 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书\n函数式编程初探 - 阮一峰的网络日志\n函数式编程 | 酷 壳 - CoolShell.cn\n\n"},"Functional/high_order_func.html":{"url":"Functional/high_order_func.html","title":"高阶函数","body":"高阶函数\n在函数式编程中，我们可以将函数当作变量一样自由使用。一个函数接收另一个函数作为参数，这种函数称之为高阶函数（Higher-order Functions）。\n看一个简单的例子：\ndef func(g, arr):\n    return [g(x) for x in arr]\n\n上面的代码中，func 是一个高阶函数，它接收两个参数，第 1 个参数是函数，第 2 个参数是数组，func 的功能是将函数 g 逐个作用于数组 arr 上，并返回一个新的数组，比如，我们可以这样用：\ndef double(x):\n    return 2 * x\n\ndef square(x):\n    return x * x\n\narr1 = func(double, [1, 2, 3, 4])\narr2 = func(square, [1, 2, 3, 4])\n不难判断出，arr1 是 [2, 4, 6, 8]，arr2 是 [1, 4, 9, 16]。\n小结\n\n可接收其他函数作为参数的函数称为高阶函数。\n\n"},"Functional/map_reduce_filter.html":{"url":"Functional/map_reduce_filter.html","title":"map/reduce/filter","body":"map/reduce/filter\nmap/reduce/filter 是 Python 中较为常用的内建高阶函数，它们为函数式编程提供了不少便利。\nmap\nmap 函数的使用形式如下：\nmap(function, sequence)\n解释：对 sequence 中的 item 依次执行 function(item)，并将结果组成一个 List 返回，也就是：\n[function(item1), function(item2), function(item3), ...]\n看一些简单的例子。\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

pt = point(7, 2)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pt(10, 6)\n5.0\n\n可以看到，结果是一样的，但使用闭包实现比使用类更加简洁。\n常见误区\n闭包的概念很简单，但实现起来却容易出现一些误区，比如下面的例子：\ndef count():\n    funcs = []\n    for i in [1, 2, 3]:\n        def f():\n            return i\n        funcs.append(f)\n    return funcs\n\n在该例子中，我们在每次 for 循环中创建了一个函数，并将它存到 funcs 中。现在，调用上面的函数，你可能认为返回结果是 1, 2, 3，事实上却不是：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f1, f2, f3 = count()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f1()\n3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f2()\n3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f3()\n3\n为什么呢？原因在于上面的函数 f 引用了变量 i，但函数 f 并非立刻执行，当 for 循环结束时，此时变量 i 的值是3，funcs 里面的函数引用的变量都是 3，最终结果也就全为 3。\n因此，我们应尽量避免在闭包中引用循环变量，或者后续会发生变化的变量。\n那上面这种情况应该怎么解决呢？我们可以再创建一个函数，并将循环变量的值传给该函数，如下：\ndef count():\n    funcs = []\n    for i in [1, 2, 3]:\n        def g(param):\n            f = lambda : param    # 这里创建了一个匿名函数\n            return f\n        funcs.append(g(i))        # 将循环变量的值传给 g\n    return funcs\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f1, f2, f3 = count()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f1()\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f2()\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f3()\n3\n\n小结\n\n闭包是携带自由变量的函数，即使创建闭包的外部函数的生命周期结束了，闭包所引用的自由变量仍会存在。\n闭包在运行可以有多个实例。\n尽量不要在闭包中引用循环变量，或者后续会发生变化的变量。\n\n参考资料\n\n返回函数 - 廖雪峰的官方网站\nWhy aren&#39;t python nested functions called closures? - Stack Overflow\n\n"},"Functional/decorator.html":{"url":"Functional/decorator.html","title":"会打扮的装饰器","body":"装饰器\n我们知道，在 Python 中，我们可以像使用变量一样使用函数：\n\n函数可以被赋值给其他变量\n函数可以被删除\n可以在函数里面再定义函数\n函数可以作为参数传递给另外一个函数\n函数可以作为另一个函数的返回\n\n简而言之，函数就是一个对象。\n对一个简单的函数进行装饰\n为了更好地理解装饰器，我们先从一个简单的例子开始，假设有下面的函数：\ndef hello():\n    return &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n现在我们想增强 hello() 函数的功能，希望给返回加上 HTML 标签，比如 &lt;i&gt;hello world&lt;/i&gt;，但是有一个要求，不改变原来 hello() 函数的定义。这里当然有很多种方法，下面给出一种跟本文相关的方法：\ndef makeitalic(func):\n    def wrapped():\n        return &quot;&lt;i&gt;&quot; + func() + &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;\n    return wrapped\n\n在上面的代码中，我们定义了一个函数 makeitalic，该函数有一个参数 func，它是一个函数；在 makeitalic 函数里面我们又定义了一个内部函数 wrapped，并将该函数作为返回。\n现在，我们就可以不改变 hello() 函数的定义，给返回加上 HTML 标签了：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello = makeitalic(hello)  # 将 hello 函数传给 makeitalic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello()\n&#39;&lt;i&gt;hello world&lt;/i&gt;&#39;\n\n在上面，我们将 hello 函数传给 makeitalic，再将返回赋给 hello，此时调用 hello() 就得到了我们想要的结果。\n不过要注意的是，由于我们将 makeitalic 的返回赋给了 hello，此时 hello() 函数仍然存在，但是它的函数名不再是 hello 了，而是 wrapped，正是 makeitalic 返回函数的名称，可以验证一下：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello.__name__\n&#39;wrapped&#39;\n\n对于这个小瑕疵，后文将会给出解决方法。\n现在，我们梳理一下上面的例子，为了增强原函数 hello 的功能，我们定义了一个函数，它接收原函数作为参数，并返回一个新的函数，完整的代码如下：\ndef makeitalic(func):\n    def wrapped():\n        return &quot;&lt;i&gt;&quot; + func() + &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;\n    return wrapped\n\ndef hello():\n    return &#39;hello world&#39;\n\nhello = makeitalic(hello)\n\n事实上，makeitalic 就是一个装饰器（decorator），它『装饰』了函数 hello，并返回一个函数，将其赋给 hello。\n一般情况下，我们使用装饰器提供的 @ 语法糖（Syntactic Sugar），来简化上面的写法：\ndef makeitalic(func):\n    def wrapped():\n        return &quot;&lt;i&gt;&quot; + func() + &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;\n    return wrapped\n\n@makeitalic\ndef hello():\n    return &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n像上面的情况，可以动态修改函数（或类）功能的函数就是装饰器。本质上，它是一个高阶函数，以被装饰的函数（比如上面的 hello）为参数，并返回一个包装后的函数（比如上面的 wrapped）给被装饰函数（hello）。\n装饰器的使用形式\n\n装饰器的一般使用形式如下：\n\n@decorator\ndef func():\n    pass\n\n等价于下面的形式：\ndef func():\n    pass\nfunc = decorator(func)\n\n\n装饰器可以定义多个，离函数定义最近的装饰器先被调用，比如：\n\n@decorator_one\n@decorator_two\ndef func():\n    pass\n\n等价于：\ndef func():\n    pass\n\nfunc = decorator_one(decorator_two(func))\n\n\n装饰器还可以带参数，比如：\n\n@decorator(arg1, arg2)\ndef func():\n    pass\n\n等价于：\ndef func():\n    pass\n\nfunc = decorator(arg1, arg2)(func)\n\n下面我们再看一些具体的例子，以加深对它的理解。\n对带参数的函数进行装饰\n前面的例子中，被装饰的函数 hello() 是没有带参数的，我们看看被装饰函数带参数的情况。对前面例子中的 hello() 函数进行改写，使其带参数，如下：\ndef makeitalic(func):\n    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):\n        ret = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        return &#39;&lt;i&gt;&#39; + ret + &#39;&lt;/i&gt;&#39;\n    return wrapped\n\n@makeitalic\ndef hello(name):\n    return &#39;hello %s&#39; % name\n\n@makeitalic\ndef hello2(name1, name2):\n    return &#39;hello %s, %s&#39; % (name1, name2)\n\n由于函数 hello 带参数，因此内嵌包装函数 wrapped 也做了一点改变：\n\n内嵌包装函数的参数传给了 func，即被装饰函数，也就是说内嵌包装函数的参数跟被装饰函数的参数对应，这里使用了 (*args, **kwargs)，是为了适应可变参数。\n\n看看使用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello(&#39;python&#39;)\n&#39;&lt;i&gt;hello python&lt;/i&gt;&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello2(&#39;python&#39;, &#39;java&#39;)\n&#39;&lt;i&gt;hello python, java&lt;/i&gt;&#39;\n\n带参数的装饰器\n上面的例子，我们增强了函数 hello 的功能，给它的返回加上了标签 &lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;，现在，我们想改用标签 &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; 或 &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;。是不是要像前面一样，再定义一个类似 makeitalic 的装饰器呢？其实，我们可以定义一个函数，将标签作为参数，返回一个装饰器，比如：\ndef wrap_in_tag(tag):\n    def decorator(func):\n        def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):\n            ret = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            return &#39;&lt;&#39; + tag + &#39;&gt;&#39; + ret + &#39;&lt;/&#39; + tag + &#39;&gt;&#39;\n        return wrapped\n\n    return decorator\n\n现在，我们可以根据需要生成想要的装饰器了：\nmakebold = wrap_in_tag(&#39;b&#39;)  # 根据 &#39;b&#39; 返回 makebold 生成器\n\n@makebold\ndef hello(name):\n    return &#39;hello %s&#39; % name\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello(&#39;world&#39;)\n&#39;&lt;b&gt;hello world&lt;/b&gt;&#39;\n\n上面的形式也可以写得更加简洁：\n@wrap_in_tag(&#39;b&#39;)\ndef hello(name):\n    return &#39;hello %s&#39; % name\n\n这就是带参数的装饰器，其实就是在装饰器外面多了一层包装，根据不同的参数返回不同的装饰器。\n多个装饰器\n现在，让我们来看看多个装饰器的例子，为了简单起见，下面的例子就不使用带参数的装饰器。\ndef makebold(func):\n    def wrapped():\n        return &#39;&lt;b&gt;&#39; + func() + &#39;&lt;/b&gt;&#39;\n\n    return wrapped\n\ndef makeitalic(func):\n    def wrapped():\n        return &#39;&lt;i&gt;&#39; + func() + &#39;&lt;/i&gt;&#39;\n\n    return wrapped\n\n@makebold\n@makeitalic\ndef hello():\n    return &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n上面定义了两个装饰器，对 hello 进行装饰，上面的最后几行代码相当于：\ndef hello():\n    return &#39;hello world&#39;\n\nhello = makebold(makeitalic(hello))\n\n调用函数 hello：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello()\n&#39;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;hello world&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&#39;\n\n基于类的装饰器\n前面的装饰器都是一个函数，其实也可以基于类定义装饰器，看下面的例子：\nclass Bold(object):\n    def __init__(self, func):\n        self.func = func\n\n    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        return &#39;&lt;b&gt;&#39; + self.func(*args, **kwargs) + &#39;&lt;/b&gt;&#39;\n\n@Bold\ndef hello(name):\n    return &#39;hello %s&#39; % name\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello(&#39;world&#39;)\n&#39;&lt;b&gt;hello world&lt;/b&gt;&#39;\n\n可以看到，类 Bold 有两个方法：\n\n__init__()：它接收一个函数作为参数，也就是被装饰的函数\n__call__()：让类对象可调用，就像函数调用一样，在调用被装饰函数时被调用\n\n还可以让类装饰器带参数：\nclass Tag(object):\n    def __init__(self, tag):\n        self.tag = tag\n\n    def __call__(self, func):\n        def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):\n            return &quot;&lt;{tag}&gt;{res}&lt;/{tag}&gt;&quot;.format(\n                res=func(*args, **kwargs), tag=self.tag\n            )\n        return wrapped\n\n@Tag(&#39;b&#39;)\ndef hello(name):\n    return &#39;hello %s&#39; % name\n\n需要注意的是，如果类装饰器有参数，则 __init__ 接收参数，而 __call__ 接收 func。\n装饰器的副作用\n前面提到，使用装饰器有一个瑕疵，就是被装饰的函数，它的函数名称已经不是原来的名称了，回到最开始的例子：\ndef makeitalic(func):\n    def wrapped():\n        return &quot;&lt;i&gt;&quot; + func() + &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;\n    return wrapped\n\n@makeitalic\ndef hello():\n    return &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n函数 hello 被 makeitalic 装饰后，它的函数名称已经改变了：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello.__name__\n&#39;wrapped&#39;\n\n为了消除这样的副作用，Python 中的 functool 包提供了一个 wraps 的装饰器：\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef makeitalic(func):\n    @wraps(func)       # 加上 wraps 装饰器\n    def wrapped():\n        return &quot;&lt;i&gt;&quot; + func() + &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;\n    return wrapped\n\n@makeitalic\ndef hello():\n    return &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello.__name__\n&#39;hello&#39;\n\n小结\n\n本质上，装饰器就是一个返回函数的高阶函数。\n装饰器可以动态地修改一个类或函数的功能，通过在原有的类或者函数上包裹一层修饰类或修饰函数实现。\n事实上，装饰器就是闭包的一种应用，但它比较特别，接收被装饰函数为参数，并返回一个函数，赋给被装饰函数，闭包则没这种限制。\n\n参考资料\n\nPython修饰器的函数式编程 - coolshell\nHow can I make a chain of function decorators in Python? - Stack Overflow\nPython中的装饰器介绍 – 思诚之道\npython装饰器入门与提高 | 赖明星\n\n"},"Functional/partial.html":{"url":"Functional/partial.html","title":"partial 函数","body":"partial 函数\nPython 提供了一个 functools 的模块，该模块为高阶函数提供支持，partial 就是其中的一个函数，该函数的形式如下：\nfunctools.partial(func[,*args][, **kwargs])\n\n这里先举个例子，看看它是怎么用的。\n假设有如下函数：\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\n现在，我们想返回某个数的双倍，即：\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

animal = Animal()  # 创建一个实例对象\n&gt;&gt;&gt; animal\n&lt;__main__.Animal at 0x1030a44d0&gt;\n\n我们在创建实例的时候，还可以传入一些参数，以初始化对象的属性，为此，我们需要添加一个 __init__ 方法：\nclass Animal(object):\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n然后，在创建实例的时候，传入参数：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; animal = Aniaml(&#39;dog1&#39;)   # 传入参数 &#39;dog1&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; animal.name               # 访问对象的 name 属性\n&#39;dog1&#39;\n\n我们可以把 __init__ 理解为对象的初始化方法，它的第一个参数永远是 self，指向创建的实例本身。定义了 __init__ 方法，我们在创建实例的时候，就需要传入与 __init__ 方法匹配的参数。\n接下来，我们再来添加一个方法：\nclass Animal(object):\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    def greet(self):\n        print &#39;Hello, I am %s.&#39;

% self.name\n\n现在，我们想创建一个 Dog 类，比如：\nclass Dog(object):\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    def greet(self):\n        print &#39;WangWang.., I am %s. &#39; % self.name\n\n可以看到，Dog 类和 Animal 类几乎是一样的，只是 greet 方法不一样，我们完全没必要创建一个新的类，而是从 Animal 类派生出一个新的类：\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def greet(self):\n        print &#39;WangWang.., I am %s. &#39; % self.name\n\nDog 类是从 Animal 类继承而来的，Dog 类自动获得了 Animal 类的所有数据和方法，而且还可以对父类的方法进行修改，我们看看使用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; animal = Animal(&#39;animal&#39;)  # 创建 animal 实例\n&gt;&gt;&gt; animal.greet()\nHello, I am animal.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; dog = Dog(&#39;dog&#39;)        # 创建 dog 实例\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dog.greet()\nWangWang.., I am dog.\n\n我们还可以对 Dog 类添加新的方法：\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def greet(self):\n        print &#39;WangWang.., I am %s. &#39; % self.name\n    def run(self):\n        print &#39;I am running.I am running&#39;\n\n使用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dog = Dog(&#39;dog&#39;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dog.greet()\nWangWang.., I am dog.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dog.run()\nI am running\n\n多态\n多态的概念其实不难理解，它是指对不同类型的变量进行相同的操作，它会根据对象（或类）类型的不同而表现出不同的行为。\n事实上，我们经常用到多态的性质，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 2\n3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;a&#39; + &#39;b&#39;\n&#39;ab&#39;\n可以看到，我们对两个整数进行 + 操作，会返回它们的和，对两个字符进行相同的 + 操作，会返回拼接后的字符串。也就是说，不同类型的对象对同一消息会作出不同的响应。\n再看看类的例子：\nclass Animal(object):\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    def greet(self):\n        print &#39;Hello, I am %s.&#39; % self.name\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def greet(self):\n        print &#39;WangWang.., I am %s.&#39; % self.name\n\nclass Cat(Animal):\n    def greet(self):\n        print &#39;MiaoMiao.., I am %s&#39; % self.name\n\ndef hello(animal):\n    animal.greet()\n\n看看多态的使用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dog = Dog(&#39;dog&#39;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello(dog)\nWangWang.., I am dog.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cat = Cat(&#39;cat&#39;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hello(cat)\nMiaoMiao.., I am cat\n\n可以看到，cat 和 dog 是两个不同的对象，对它们调用 greet 方法，它们会自动调用实际类型的 greet 方法，作出不同的响应。这就是多态的魅力。\n小结\n\n继承可以拿到父类的所有数据和方法，子类可以重写父类的方法，也可以新增自己特有的方法。\n有了继承，才有了多态，不同类的对象对同一消息会作出不同的相应。\n\n"},"Class/method.html":{"url":"Class/method.html","title":"类方法和静态方法","body":"类方法和静态方法\n在讲类方法和静态方法之前，先来看一个简单的例子：\nclass A(object):\n    def foo(self):\n        print &#39;Hello &#39;, self\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.foo()\nHello,  &lt;__main__.A object at 0x10c37a450&gt;\n\n在上面，我们定义了一个类 A，它有一个方法 foo，然后我们创建了一个对象 a，并调用方法 foo。\n类方法\n如果我们想通过类来调用方法，而不是通过实例，那应该怎么办呢？\nPython 提供了 classmethod 装饰器让我们实现上述功能，看下面的例子：\nclass A(object):\n    bar = 1\n    @classmethod\n    def class_foo(cls):\n        print &#39;Hello, &#39;, cls\n        print cls.bar\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A.class_foo()   # 直接通过类来调用方法\nHello,  &lt;class &#39;__main__.A&#39;&gt;\n1\n\n在上面，我们使用了 classmethod 装饰方法 class_foo，它就变成了一个类方法，class_foo 的参数是 cls，代表类本身，当我们使用 A.class_foo() 时，cls 就会接收 A 作为参数。另外，被 classmethod 装饰的方法由于持有 cls 参数，因此我们可以在方法里面调用类的属性、方法，比如 cls.bar。\n静态方法\n在类中往往有一些方法跟类有关系，但是又不会改变类和实例状态的方法，这种方法是静态方法，我们使用 staticmethod 来装饰，比如下面的例子：\nclass A(object):\n    bar = 1\n    @staticmethod\n    def static_foo():\n        print &#39;Hello, &#39;, A.bar\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.static_foo()\nHello, 1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A.static_foo()\nHello, 1\n\n可以看到，静态方法没有 self 和 cls 参数，可以把它看成是一个普通的函数，我们当然可以把它写到类外面，但这是不推荐的，因为这不利于代码的组织和命名空间的整洁。\n小结\n\n类方法使用 @classmethod 装饰器，可以使用类（也可使用实例）来调用方法。\n静态方法使用 @staticmethod 装饰器，它是跟类有关系但在运行时又不需要实例和类参与的方法，可以使用类和实例来调用。\n\n"},"Class/magic_method.html":{"url":"Class/magic_method.html","title":"定制类和魔法方法","body":"定制类和魔法方法\n在 Python 中，我们可以经常看到以双下划线 __ 包裹起来的方法，比如最常见的 __init__，这些方法被称为魔法方法（magic method）或特殊方法（special method）。简单地说，这些方法可以给 Python 的类提供特殊功能，方便我们定制一个类，比如 __init__ 方法可以对类属性进行初始化。\n完整的特殊方法列表可在这里查看，本文只介绍以下一些常用的特殊方法：\n\n__str__ , __repr__\n__iter__\n__getitem__ , __setitem__ , __delitem__\n__getattr__ , __setattr__ , __delattr__\n__call__\n\nstr &amp;

% self.name\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print Foo(&#39;ethan&#39;)      # 使用 print\nFoo object (name: ethan)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; str(Foo(&#39;ethan&#39;))       # 使用 str\n&#39;Foo object (name: ethan)&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo(&#39;ethan&#39;)             # 直接显示\n&lt;__main__.Foo at 0x10c37a490&gt;\n\n可以看到，使用 print 和 str 输出的是 __str__ 方法返回的内容，但如果直接显示则不是，那能不能修改它的输出呢？当然可以，我们只需在类中加入 __repr__ 方法，比如：\nclass Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    def __str__(self):\n        return &#39;Foo object (name: %s)&#39;

% self.name\n    __repr__ = __str__\n\niter\n在某些情况下，我们希望实例对象可被用于 for...in 循环，这时我们需要在类中定义 __iter__ 和 next（在 Python3 中是 __next__）方法，其中，__iter__ 返回一个迭代对象，next 返回容器的下一个元素，在没有后续元素时抛出 StopIteration 异常。\n看一个斐波那契数列的例子：\nclass Fib(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.a, self.b = 0, 1\n\n    def __iter__(self):  # 返回迭代器对象本身\n        return self      \n\n    def next(self):      # 返回容器下一个元素\n        self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b\n        return self.a    \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fib = Fib()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in fib:\n...     if i &gt; 10:\n...         break\n...     print i\n...\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n\ngetitem\n有时，我们希望可以使用 obj[n] 这种方式对实例对象进行取值，比如对斐波那契数列，我们希望可以取出其中的某一项，这时我们需要在类中实现 __getitem__ 方法，比如下面的例子：\nclass Fib(object):\n    def __getitem__(self, n):\n        a, b = 1, 1\n        for x in xrange(n):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return a\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fib = Fib()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fib[0], fib[1], fib[2], fib[3], fib[4], fib[5]\n(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)\n\n我们还想更进一步，希望支持 obj[1:3] 这种切片方法来取值，这时 __getitem__ 方法传入的参数可能是一个整数，也可能是一个切片对象 slice，因此，我们需要对传入的参数进行判断，可以使用 isinstance 进行判断，改后的代码如下：\nclass Fib(object):\n    def __getitem__(self, n):\n        if isinstance(n, slice):   # 如果 n 是 slice 对象\n            a, b = 1, 1\n            start, stop = n.start, n.stop\n            L = []\n            for i in xrange(stop):\n                if i &gt;= start:\n                    L.append(a)\n                a, b = b, a + b\n            return L\n        if isinstance(n, int):     # 如果 n 是 int 型\n            a, b = 1, 1\n            for i in xrange(n):\n                a, b = b, a + b\n            return a\n\n现在，我们试试用切片方法：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fib = Fib()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fib[0:3]\n[1, 1, 2]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fib[2:6]\n[2, 3, 5, 8]\n\n上面，我们只是简单地演示了 getitem 的操作，但是它还很不完善，比如没有对负数处理，不支持带 step 参数的切片操作 obj[1:2:5] 等等，读者有兴趣的话可以自己实现看看。\n__geitem__ 用于获取值，类似地，__setitem__ 用于设置值，__delitem__ 用于删除值，让我们看下面一个例子：\nclass Point(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.coordinate = {}\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return &quot;point(%s)&quot;

% key\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.coordinate)\n\n    __repr__ = __str__\n\n在上面，我们定义了一个 Point 类，它有一个属性 coordinate（坐标），是一个字典，让我们看看使用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Point()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p[&#39;x&#39;] = 2    # 对应于 p.__setitem__(&#39;x&#39;, 2)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

p[&#39;x&#39;]        # 对应于 p.__getitem__(&#39;x&#39;)\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p[&#39;y&#39;]        # 对应于 p.__getitem__(&#39;y&#39;)\n5\n&gt;&gt;&gt; del p[&#39;x&#39;]    # 对应于 p.__delitem__(&#39;x&#39;)\ndelete x\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p\npoint({&#39;y&#39;: 5})\n&gt;&gt;&gt; len(p)\n1\n\ngetattr\n当我们获取对象的某个属性，如果该属性不存在，会抛出 AttributeError 异常，比如：\nclass Point(object):\n    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

p = Point(3, 4)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p.z\n0\n\n现在，当我们调用不存在的属性（比如 z）时，解释器就会试图调用 __getattr__(self, &#39;z&#39;) 来获取值，但是，上面的实现还有一个问题，当我们调用其他属性，比如 w ，会返回 None，因为 __getattr__ 默认返回就是 None，只有当 attr 等于 &#39;z&#39; 时才返回 0，如果我们想让 __getattr__ 只响应几个特定的属性，可以加入异常处理，修改 __getattr__ 方法，如下：\ndef __getattr__(self, attr):\n    if attr == &#39;z&#39;:\n        return 0\n    raise AttributeError(&quot;Point object has no attribute %s&quot; % attr)\n\n这里再强调一点，__getattr__ 只有在属性不存在的情况下才会被调用，对已存在的属性不会调用 __getattr__。\n与 __getattr__ 一起使用的还有 __setattr__, __delattr__，类似 obj.attr = value, del obj.attr，看下面一个例子：\nclass Point(object):\n    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def __getattr__(self, attr):\n        if attr == &#39;z&#39;:\n            return 0\n        raise AttributeError(&quot;Point object has no attribute %s&quot;

p = Point(3, 4)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; callable(p)     # 使用 callable 判断对象是否能被调用\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p(6)            # 传入参数，对实例进行调用，对应 p.__call__(6)\n13                  # 3+4+6\n\n可以看到，对实例进行调用就好像对函数调用一样。\n小结\n\n__str__ 是用 print 和 str 显示的结果，__repr__ 是直接显示的结果。\n__getitem__ 用类似 obj[key] 的方式对对象进行取值\n__getattr__ 用于获取不存在的属性 obj.attr\n__call__ 使得可以对实例进行调用\n\n参考资料\n\n定制类\nsetitem implementation in Python for Point(x,y) class - Stack Overflow\nPython对象的特殊属性和方法 | Hom\n介绍Python的魔术方法 - Magic Method - 旺酱的专栏 - SegmentFault\n\n"},"Class/slots.html":{"url":"Class/slots.html","title":"slots 魔法","body":"slots 魔法\n在 Python 中，我们在定义类的时候可以定义属性和方法。当我们创建了一个类的实例后，我们还可以给该实例绑定任意新的属性和方法。\n看下面一个简单的例子：\nclass Point(object):    \n    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

e.set_score(70)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; e.get_score()\n70\n\n在上面，我们定义了一个 Exam 类，为了避免直接对 _score 属性操作，我们提供了 get_score 和 set_score 方法，这样起到了封装的作用，把一些不想对外公开的属性隐蔽起来，而只是提供方法给用户操作，在方法里面，我们可以检查参数的合理性等。\n这样做没什么问题，但是我们有更简单的方式来做这件事，Python 提供了 property 装饰器，被装饰的方法，我们可以将其『当作』属性来用，看下面的例子：\nclass Exam(object):\n    def __init__(self, score):\n        self._score = score\n\n    @property\n    def score(self):\n        return self._score\n\n    @score.setter\n    def score(self, val):\n        if val &lt;

dog = Dog(&#39;dog&#39;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dog.greet()\nHello, I am dog.\nWangWang..\n\nsuper 的一个最常见用法可以说是在子类中调用父类的初始化方法了，比如：\nclass Base(object):\n    def __init__(self, a, b):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n\nclass A(Base):\n    def __init__(self, a, b, c):\n        super(A, self).__init__(a, b)  # Python3 可使用 super().__init__(a, b)\n        self.c = c\n\n深入 super()\n看了上面的使用，你可能会觉得 super 的使用很简单，无非就是获取了父类，并调用父类的方法。其实，在上面的情况下，super 获得的类刚好是父类，但在其他情况就不一定了，super 其实和父类没有实质性的关联。\n让我们看一个稍微复杂的例子，涉及到多重继承，代码如下：\nclass Base(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print &quot;enter Base&quot;\n        print &quot;leave Base&quot;\n\nclass A(Base):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print &quot;enter A&quot;\n        super(A, self).__init__()\n        print &quot;leave A&quot;\n\nclass B(Base):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print &quot;enter B&quot;\n        super(B, self).__init__()\n        print &quot;leave B&quot;\n\nclass C(A, B):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print &quot;enter C&quot;\n        super(C, self).__init__()\n        print &quot;leave C&quot;\n\n其中，Base 是父类，A, B 继承自 Base, C 继承自 A, B，它们的继承关系是一个典型的『菱形继承』，如下：\n      Base\n      /  \\\n     /    \\\n    A      B\n     \\    /\n      \\  /\n       C\n现在，让我们看一下使用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c = C()\nenter C\nenter A\nenter B\nenter Base\nleave Base\nleave B\nleave A\nleave C\n\n如果你认为 super 代表『调用父类的方法』，那你很可能会疑惑为什么 enter A 的下一句不是 enter Base 而是 enter B。原因是，super 和父类没有实质性的关联，现在让我们搞清 super 是怎么运作的。\nMRO 列表\n事实上，对于你定义的每一个类，Python 会计算出一个方法解析顺序（Method Resolution Order, MRO）列表，它代表了类继承的顺序，我们可以使用下面的方式获得某个类的 MRO 列表：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; C.mro()   # or C.__mro__ or C().__class__.mro()\n[__main__.C, __main__.A, __main__.B, __main__.Base, object]\n\n那这个 MRO 列表的顺序是怎么定的呢，它是通过一个 C3 线性化算法来实现的，这里我们就不去深究这个算法了，感兴趣的读者可以自己去了解一下，总的来说，一个类的 MRO 列表就是合并所有父类的 MRO 列表，并遵循以下三条原则：\n\n子类永远在父类前面\n如果有多个父类，会根据它们在列表中的顺序被检查\n如果对下一个类存在两个合法的选择，选择第一个父类\n\nsuper 原理\nsuper 的工作原理如下：\ndef super(cls, inst):\n    mro = inst.__class__.mro()\n    return mro[mro.index(cls) + 1]\n\n其中，cls 代表类，inst 代表实例，上面的代码做了两件事：\n\n获取 inst 的 MRO 列表\n查找 cls 在当前 MRO 列表中的 index, 并返回它的下一个类，即 mro[index + 1] \n\n当你使用 super(cls, inst) 时，Python 会在 inst 的 MRO 列表上搜索 cls 的下一个类。\n现在，让我们回到前面的例子。\n首先看类 C 的 __init__ 方法：\nsuper(C, self).__init__()\n这里的 self 是当前 C 的实例，self.class.mro() 结果是：\n[__main__.C, __main__.A, __main__.B, __main__.Base, object]\n可以看到，C 的下一个类是 A，于是，跳到了 A 的 __init__，这时会打印出 enter A，并执行下面一行代码：\nsuper(A, self).__init__()\n\n注意，这里的 self 也是当前 C 的实例，MRO 列表跟上面是一样的，搜索 A 在 MRO 中的下一个类，发现是 B，于是，跳到了 B 的 __init__，这时会打印出 enter B，而不是 enter Base。\n整个过程还是比较清晰的，关键是要理解 super 的工作方式，而不是想当然地认为 super 调用了父类的方法。\n小结\n\n事实上，super 和父类没有实质性的关联。\nsuper(cls, inst) 获得的是 cls 在 inst 的 MRO 列表中的下一个类。\n\n参考资料\n\n调用父类方法 — python3-cookbook 2.0.0 文档\n理解 Python super - laike9m&#39;s blog\npython super() - 漩涡鸣人 - 博客园\nPython:super函数 | Hom\nPython’s super() considered super! | Deep Thoughts by Raymond Hettinger\nPython super() inheritance and needed arguments - Stack Overflow\n\n"},"Class/metaclass.html":{"url":"Class/metaclass.html","title":"陌生的 metaclass","body":"陌生的 metaclass\nPython 中的元类（metaclass）是一个深度魔法，平时我们可能比较少接触到元类，本文将通过一些简单的例子来理解这个魔法。\n类也是对象\n在 Python 中，一切皆对象。字符串，列表，字典，函数是对象，类也是一个对象，因此你可以：\n\n把类赋值给一个变量\n把类作为函数参数进行传递\n把类作为函数的返回值\n在运行时动态地创建类\n\n看一个简单的例子：\nclass Foo(object):\n    foo = True\n\nclass Bar(object):\n    bar = True\n\ndef echo(cls):\n    print cls\n\ndef select(name):\n    if name == &#39;foo&#39;:\n        return Foo        # 返回值是一个类\n    if name == &#39;bar&#39;:\n        return Bar\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

+ name, value) for name, value in attrs.items())  \n\n        _attrs = dict((name, value) for name, value in _attrs)  # 转化为字典\n        _attrs[&#39;echo&#39;] = lambda self, phrase: phrase  # 增加了一个 echo 方法\n\n        return type.__new__(cls, name, bases, _attrs)  # 返回创建后的类\n\n上面的代码有几个需要注意的点：\n\nPrefixMetaClass 从 type 继承，这是因为 PrefixMetaclass 是用来创建类的\n__new__ 是在 __init__ 之前被调用的特殊方法，它用来创建对象并返回创建后的对象，对它的参数解释如下：\ncls：当前准备创建的类\nname：类的名字\nbases：类的父类集合\nattrs：类的属性和方法，是一个字典\n\n\n\n2.接着，我们需要指示 Foo 使用 PrefixMetaclass 来定制类。\n在 Python2 中，我们只需在 Foo 中加一个 __metaclass__ 的属性，如下：\nclass Foo(object):\n    __metaclass__ = PrefixMetaclass\n    name = &#39;foo&#39;\n    def bar(self):\n        print &#39;bar&#39;\n\n在 Python3 中，这样做：\nclass Foo(metaclass=PrefixMetaclass):\n    name = &#39;foo&#39;\n    def bar(self):\n        print &#39;bar&#39;\n\n现在，让我们看看使用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Foo()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f.name    # name 属性已经被改变\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-774-4511c8475833&gt;

f.echo(&#39;hello&#39;)\n&#39;hello&#39;\n\n可以看到，Foo 原来的属性 name 已经变成了 my_name，而方法 bar 也变成了 my_bar，这就是元类的魔法。\n再来看一个继承的例子，下面是完整的代码：\nclass PrefixMetaclass(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):\n        # 给所有属性和方法前面加上前缀 my_\n        _attrs = ((&#39;my_&#39; + name, value) for name, value in attrs.items())  \n\n        _attrs = dict((name, value) for name, value in _attrs)  # 转化为字典\n        _attrs[&#39;echo&#39;] = lambda self, phrase: phrase  # 增加了一个 echo 方法\n\n        return type.__new__(cls, name, bases, _attrs)\n\nclass Foo(object):\n    __metaclass__ = PrefixMetaclass   # 注意跟 Python3 的写法有所区别\n    name = &#39;foo&#39;\n    def bar(self):\n        print &#39;bar&#39;\n\nclass Bar(Foo):\n    prop = &#39;bar&#39;\n\n其中，PrefixMetaclass 和 Foo 跟前面的定义是一样的，只是新增了 Bar，它继承自 Foo。先让我们看看使用：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Bar()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b.prop     # 发现没这个属性\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-778-825e0b6563ea&gt;

b.my_bar()\nbar\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b.echo(&#39;hello&#39;)\n&#39;hello&#39;\n\n我们发现，Bar 没有 prop 这个属性，但是有 my_prop 这个属性，这是为什么呢？\n原来，当我们定义 class Bar(Foo) 时，Python 会首先在当前类，即 Bar 中寻找 __metaclass__，如果没有找到，就会在父类 Foo 中寻找 __metaclass__，如果找不到，就继续在 Foo 的父类寻找，如此继续下去，如果在任何父类都找不到 __metaclass__，就会到模块层次中寻找，如果还是找不到，就会用 type 来创建这个类。\n这里，我们在 Foo 找到了 __metaclass__，Python 会使用 PrefixMetaclass 来创建 Bar，也就是说，元类会隐式地继承到子类，虽然没有显示地在子类使用 __metaclass__，这也解释了为什么 Bar 的 prop 属性被动态修改成了 my_prop。\n写到这里，不知道你理解元类了没？希望理解了，如果没理解，就多看几遍吧~\n小结\n\n在 Python 中，类也是一个对象。\n类创建实例，元类创建类。\n元类主要做了三件事：\n拦截类的创建\n修改类的定义\n返回修改后的类\n\n\n当你创建类时，解释器会调用元类来生成它，定义一个继承自 object 的普通类意味着调用 type 来创建它。\n\n参考资料\n\noop - What is a metaclass in Python? - Stack Overflow\n深刻理解Python中的元类(metaclass) - 伯乐在线\n使用元类 - 廖雪峰的官方网站\nPython基础：元类\n在Python中使用class decorator和metaclass\n\n"},"Advanced-Features/":{"url":"Advanced-Features/","title":"高级特性","body":"高级特性\n本章主要介绍：\n\n迭代器\n生成器\n上下文管理器\n\n"},"Advanced-Features/iterator.html":{"url":"Advanced-Features/iterator.html","title":"迭代器","body":"迭代器 (Iterator)\n迭代和可迭代\n迭代器这个概念在很多语言中（比如 C++，Java）都是存在的，但是不同语言实现迭代器的方式各不相同。在 Python 中，迭代器是指遵循迭代器协议（iterator protocol）的对象。至于什么是迭代器协议，稍后自然会说明。为了更好地理解迭代器，我先介绍和迭代器相关的两个概念：\n\n迭代（Iteration）\n可迭代对象（Iterable）\n\n你可能会觉得这是在玩文字游戏，但这确实是要搞清楚的。\n\n当我们用一个循环（比如 for 循环）来遍历容器（比如列表，元组）中的元素时，这种遍历的过程就叫迭代。\n\n在 Python 中，我们使用 for...in... 进行迭代。比如，遍历一个 list:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nfor num in numbers:\n    print num\n\n像上面这种可以使用 for 循环进行迭代的对象，就是可迭代对象，它的定义如下：\n\n含有 __iter__() 方法或 __getitem__() 方法的对象称之为可迭代对象。\n\n我们可以使用 Python 内置的 hasattr() 函数来判断一个对象是不是可迭代的：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr((), &#39;__iter__&#39;)\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr([], &#39;__iter__&#39;)\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr({}, &#39;__iter__&#39;)\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(123, &#39;__iter__&#39;)\nFalse\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

10:\n            break\n        print i\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    main()\n\n在上面的代码中，我们定义了一个 Fib 类，用于生成 Fibonacci 数列。在类的实现中，我们定义了 __iter__ 方法，它返回对象本身，这个方法会在遍历时被 Python 内置的 iter() 函数调用，返回一个迭代器。类中的 next() 方法用于返回容器的下一个元素，当使用 for 循环进行遍历的时候，就会使用 Python 内置的 next() 函数调用对象的 next 方法（在 Python3 中是 __next__ 方法）对迭代器进行遍历。\n运行上面的代码，可得到如下结果：\nisinstance(fib, Iterator):  True\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n小结\n\n元组、列表、字典和字符串对象是可迭代的，但不是迭代器，不过我们可以通过 iter() 函数获得一个迭代器对象；\nPython 的 for 循环实质上是先通过内置函数 iter() 获得一个迭代器，然后再不断调用 next() 函数实现的；\n自定义迭代器需要实现对象的 __iter()__ 和 next() 方法（注意：Python3 要实现 __next__() 方法），其中，__iter()__ 方法返回迭代器对象本身，next() 方法返回容器的下一个元素，在没有后续元素时抛出 StopIteration 异常。\n\n参考资料\n\nCallback or Iterator in Python\n迭代器 - 廖雪峰的官方网站\n\n"},"Advanced-Features/generator.html":{"url":"Advanced-Features/generator.html","title":"生成器","body":"生成器\n生成器（generator）也是一种迭代器，在每次迭代时返回一个值，直到抛出 StopIteration 异常。它有两种构造方式：\n\n生成器表达式\n\n和列表推导式的定义类似，生成器表达式使用 () 而不是 []，比如：\nnumbers = (x for x in range(5))   # 注意是()，而不是[]\nfor num in numbers:\n    print num\n\n生成器函数\n\n含有 yield 关键字的函数，调用该函数时会返回一个生成器。\n本文主要讲生成器函数。\n生成器函数\n先来看一个简单的例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def generator_function():\n...     print &#39;hello 1&#39;\n...     yield 1\n...     print &#39;hello 2&#39;\n...     yield 2\n...     print &#39;hello 3&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g = generator_function()  # 函数没有立即执行，而是返回了一个生成器，当然也是一个迭代器\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.next()  # 当使用 next() 方法，或使用 next(g) 的时候开始执行，遇到 yield 暂停\nhello 1\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.next()    # 从原来暂停的地方继续执行\nhello 2\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.next()    # 从原来暂停的地方继续执行，没有 yield，抛出异常\nhello 3\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nStopIteration\n\n可以看到，上面的函数没有使用 return 语句返回值，而是使用了 yield『生出』一个值。一个带有 yield 的函数就是一个生成器函数，当我们使用 yield 时，它帮我们自动创建了 __iter__() 和 next() 方法，而且在没有数据时，也会抛出 StopIteration 异常，也就是我们不费吹灰之力就获得了一个迭代器，非常简洁和高效。\n带有 yield 的函数执行过程比较特别：\n\n调用该函数的时候不会立即执行代码，而是返回了一个生成器对象；\n当使用 next() (在 for 循环中会自动调用 next()) 作用于返回的生成器对象时，函数开始执行，在遇到 yield 的时候会『暂停』，并返回当前的迭代值；\n当再次使用 next() 的时候，函数会从原来『暂停』的地方继续执行，直到遇到 yield 语句，如果没有 yield 语句，则抛出异常；\n\n整个过程看起来就是不断地 执行-&gt;中断-&gt;执行-&gt;中断 的过程。一开始，调用生成器函数的时候，函数不会立即执行，而是返回一个生成器对象；然后，当我们使用 next() 作用于它的时候，它开始执行，遇到 yield 语句的时候，执行被中断，并返回当前的迭代值，要注意的是，此刻会记住中断的位置和所有的变量值，也就是执行时的上下文环境被保留起来；当再次使用 next() 的时候，从原来中断的地方继续执行，直至遇到 yield，如果没有 yield，则抛出异常。\n简而言之，就是 next 使函数执行，yield 使函数暂停。\n例子\n看一个 Fibonacci 数列的例子，如果使用自定义迭代器的方法，是这样的：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class Fib(object):\n...     def __init__(self):\n...         self.a, self.b = 0, 1\n...     def __iter__(self):\n...         return self\n...     def next(self):\n...         self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b\n...         return self.a\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Fib()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in f:\n...     if item &gt; 10:\n...         break\n...     print item\n...\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n\n而使用生成器的方法，是这样的：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def fib():\n...     a, b = 0, 1\n...     while True:\n...         a, b = b, a + b\n...         yield a\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f = fib()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in f:\n...     if item &gt; 10:\n...         break\n...     print item\n...\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n\n可以看到，使用生成器的方法非常简洁，不用自定义 __iter__() 和 next() 方法。\n另外，在处理大文件的时候，我们可能无法一次性将其载入内存，这时可以通过构造固定长度的缓冲区，来不断读取文件内容。有了 yield，我们就不用自己实现读文件的迭代器了，比如下面的实现：\ndef read_in_chunks(file_object, chunk_size=1024):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Lazy function (generator) to read a file piece by piece.\n    Default chunk size: 1k.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    while True:\n        data = file_object.read(chunk_size)\n        if not data:\n            break\n        yield data\n\nf = open(&#39;really_big_file.dat&#39;)\nfor piece in read_in_chunks(f):\n    process_data(piece)\n\n进阶使用\n我们除了能对生成器进行迭代使它返回值外，还能：\n\n使用 send() 方法给它发送消息；\n使用 thow() 方法给它发送异常；\n使用 close() 方法关闭生成器；\n\nsend() 方法\n看一个简单的例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def generator_function():\n...     value1 = yield 0\n...     print &#39;value1 is &#39;, value1\n...     value2 = yield 1\n...     print &#39;value2 is &#39;, value2\n...     value3 = yield 2\n...     print &#39;value3 is &#39;, value3\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g = generator_function()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.next()   # 调用 next() 方法开始执行，返回 0\n0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.send(2)\nvalue1 is  2\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.send(3)\nvalue2 is  3\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.send(4)\nvalue3 is  4\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nStopIteration\n在上面的代码中，我们先调用 next() 方法，使函数开始执行，代码执行到 yield 0 的时候暂停，返回了 0；接着，我们执行了 send() 方法，它会恢复生成器的运行，并将发送的值赋给上次中断时 yield 表达式的执行结果，也就是 value1，这时控制台打印出 value1 的值，并继续执行，直到遇到 yield 后暂停，此时返回 1；类似地，再次执行 send() 方法，将值赋给 value2。\n简单地说，send() 方法就是 next() 的功能，加上传值给 yield。\nthrow() 方法\n除了可以给生成器传值，我们还可以给它传异常，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def generator_function():\n...     try:\n...         yield &#39;Normal&#39;\n...     except ValueError:\n...         yield &#39;Error&#39;\n...     finally:\n...         print &#39;Finally&#39;\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g = generator_function()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.next()\n&#39;Normal&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.throw(ValueError)\n&#39;Error&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.next()\nFinally\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nStopIteration\n\n可以看到，throw() 方法向生成器函数传递了 ValueError 异常，此时代码进入 except ValueError 语句，遇到 yield &#39;Error&#39;，暂停并返回 Error 字符串。\n简单的说，throw() 就是 next() 的功能，加上传异常给 yield。\nclose() 方法\n我们可以使用 close() 方法来关闭一个生成器。生成器被关闭后，再次调用 next() 方法，不管能否遇到 yield 关键字，都会抛出 StopIteration 异常，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def generator_function():\n...     yield 1\n...     yield 2\n...     yield 3\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g = generator_function()\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.next()\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g.close()  # 关闭生成器\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

模式表示读模式，open 函数的常用模式主要有：\n\n\n\n‘r&#39;\n读模式\n\n\n\n\n‘w&#39;\n写模式\n\n\n‘a&#39;\n追加模式\n\n\n‘b&#39;\n二进制模式（可添加到其他模式中使用）\n\n\n‘+&#39;\n读/写模式（可添加到其他模式中使用）\n\n\n\n上面的读文件做法很繁琐，我们可以使用 Python 的 with 语句来帮我们自动调用 close 方法：\nwith open(&#39;/path/to/file&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f:\n    data = f.read()\n\n可以看到，这种方式很简洁，而且还能在出现异常的情况下自动关闭文件。\n通常而言，读取文件有以下几种方式：\n\n一次性读取所有内容，使用 read() 或 readlines()；\n按字节读取，使用 read(size)；\n按行读取，使用 readline()；\n\n读取所有内容\n读取所有内容可以使用 read() 或 readlines()。我们在上面已经介绍过 read() 了，现在，让我们看看 readlines()。\nreadlines() 方法会把文件读入一个字符串列表，在列表中每个字符串就是一行。\n假设有一个文件 data.txt，它的文件内容如下（数字之间的间隔符是&#39;\\t&#39;）：\n10  1   9   9\n6   3   2   8\n20  10  3   23\n1   4   1   10\n10  8   6   3\n10  2   1   6\n\n我们使用 readlines() 将文件读入一个字符串列表：\nwith open(&#39;data.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f:\n    lines = f.readlines()\n    line_num = len(lines)\n    print lines\n    print line_num\n\n执行结果：\n[&#39;10\\t1\\t9\\t9\\n&#39;, &#39;6\\t3\\t2\\t8\\n&#39;, &#39;20\\t10\\t3\\t23\\n&#39;, &#39;1\\t4\\t1\\t10\\n&#39;, &#39;10\\t8\\t6\\t3\\n&#39;, &#39;10\\t2\\t1\\t6&#39;]\n6\n可以看到，列表中的每个元素都是一个字符串，刚好对应文件中的每一行。\n按字节读取\n如果文件较小，一次性读取所有内容确实比较方便。但是，如果文件很大，比如有 100G，那就不能一次性读取所有内容了。这时，我们构造一个固定长度的缓冲区，来不断读取文件内容。\n看看例子：\nwith open(&#39;path/to/file&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f:\n    while True:\n        piece = f.read(1024)        # 每次读取 1024 个字节（即 1 KB）的内容\n        if not piece:\n            break\n        print piece\n\n在上面，我们使用 f.read(1024) 来每次读取 1024 个字节（1KB） 的文件内容，将其存到 piece，再对 piece 进行处理。\n事实上，我们还可以结合 yield 来使用：\ndef read_in_chunks(file_object, chunk_size=1024):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Lazy function (generator) to read a file piece by piece.\n    Default chunk size: 1k.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    while True:\n        data = file_object.read(chunk_size)\n        if not data:\n            break\n        yield data\n\nwith open(&#39;path/to/file&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f:\n    for piece in read_in_chunks(f):\n        print piece\n\n逐行读取\n在某些情况下，我们希望逐行读取文件，这时可以使用 readline() 方法。\n看看例子：\nwith open(&#39;data.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f:\n    while True:\n        line = f.readline()     # 逐行读取\n        if not line:\n            break\n        print line,             # 这里加了 &#39;,&#39; 是为了避免 print 自动换行\n\n执行结果：\n10  1   9   9\n6   3   2   8\n20  10  3   23\n1   4   1   10\n10  8   6   3\n10  2   1   6\n文件迭代器\n在 Python 中，文件对象是可迭代的，这意味着我们可以直接在 for 循环中使用它们，而且是逐行迭代的，也就是说，效果和 readline() 是一样的，而且更简洁。\n看看例子：\nwith open(&#39;data.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f:\n    for line in f:\n        print line,\n\n在上面的代码中，f 就是一个文件迭代器，因此我们可以直接使用 for line in f，它是逐行迭代的。\n看看执行结果：\n10  1   9   9\n6   3   2   8\n20  10  3   23\n1   4   1   10\n10  8   6   3\n10  2   1   6\n\n再看一个例子：\nwith open(file_path, &#39;r&#39;) as f:\n    lines = list(f)\n    print lines\n\n执行结果：\n[&#39;10\\t1\\t9\\t9\\n&#39;, &#39;6\\t3\\t2\\t8\\n&#39;, &#39;20\\t10\\t3\\t23\\n&#39;, &#39;1\\t4\\t1\\t10\\n&#39;, &#39;10\\t8\\t6\\t3\\n&#39;, &#39;10\\t2\\t1\\t6&#39;]\n\n可以看到，我们可以对文件迭代器执行和普通迭代器相同的操作，比如上面使用 list(open(filename)) 将 f 转为一个字符串列表，这样所达到的效果和使用 readlines 是一样的。\n写文件\n写文件使用 write 方法，如下：\nwith open(&#39;/Users/ethan/data2.txt&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as f:\n    f.write(&#39;one\\n&#39;)\n    f.write(&#39;two&#39;)\n\n\n如果上述文件已存在，则会清空原内容并覆盖掉；\n如果上述路径是正确的（比如存在 /Users/ethan 的路径），但是文件不存在（data2.txt 不存在），则会新建一个文件，并写入上述内容；\n如果上述路径是不正确的（比如将路径写成 /Users/eth ），这时会抛出 IOError；\n\n如果我们想往已存在的文件追加内容，可以使用 &#39;a&#39; 模式，如下：\nwith open(&#39;/Users/ethan/data2.txt&#39;, &#39;a&#39;) as f:\n    f.write(&#39;three\\n&#39;)\n    f.write(&#39;four&#39;)\n\n小结\n\n推荐使用 with 语句操作文件 IO。\n如果文件较大，可以按字节读取或按行读取。\n使用文件迭代器进行逐行迭代。\n\n参考资料\n\n《Python 基础教程》\n读写文本数据 — python3-cookbook 2.0.0 文档\n\n"},"File-Directory/binary_file_io.html":{"url":"File-Directory/binary_file_io.html","title":"读写二进制文件","body":"读写二进制文件\nPython 不仅支持文本文件的读写，也支持二进制文件的读写，比如图片，声音文件等。\n读取二进制文件\n读取二进制文件使用 &#39;rb&#39;

   // 使用 fork 函数\n\n    if (pid &lt; 0) {\n        printf(&quot;Fail to create process\\n&quot;);\n    }\n    else if (pid == 0) {\n        printf(&quot;I am child process (%d) and my parent is (%d)\\n&quot;, getpid(), getppid());\n    }\n    else {\n        printf(&quot;I (%d) just created a child process (%d)\\n&quot;, getpid(), pid);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n其中，getpid 用于获取当前进程号，getppid 用于获取父进程号。\n事实上，Python 的 os 模块包含了普遍的操作系统功能，该模块也提供了 fork 函数，把上面的代码改成用 Python 来实现，如下：\nimport os\n\npid = os.fork()\n\nif pid &lt; 0:\n    print &#39;Fail to create process&#39;\nelif pid == 0:\n    print &#39;I am child process (%s) and my parent is (%s).&#39; % (os.getpid(), os.getppid())\nelse:\n    print &#39;I (%s) just created a child process (%s).&#39; % (os.getpid(), pid)\n\n运行上面的代码，产生如下输出：\nI (86645) just created a child process (86646).\nI am child process (86646) and my parent is (86645).\n需要注意的是，虽然子进程复制了父进程的代码段和数据段等，但是一旦子进程开始运行，子进程和父进程就是相互独立的，它们之间不再共享任何数据。\n多进程\nPython 提供了一个 multiprocessing 模块，利用它，我们可以来编写跨平台的多进程程序。\n我们先来看一个简单的例子，该例子演示了在主进程中启动一个子进程，并等待其结束，代码如下：\nimport os\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\n\n# 子进程要执行的代码\ndef child_proc(name):\n    print &#39;Run child process %s (%s)...&#39; % (name, os.getpid())\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    print &#39;Parent process %s.&#39; % os.getpid()\n    p = Process(target=child_proc, args=(&#39;test&#39;,))\n    print &#39;Process will start.&#39;\n    p.start()\n    p.join()\n    print &#39;Process end.&#39;\n\n在上面的代码中，我们从 multiprocessing 模块引入了 Process，Process 是一个用于创建进程对象的类，其中，target 指定了进程要执行的函数，args 指定了参数。在创建了进程实例 p 之后，我们调用 start 方法开始执行该子进程，接着，我们又调用了 join 方法，该方法用于阻塞子进程以外的所有进程（这里指父进程），当子进程执行完毕后，父进程才会继续执行，它通常用于进程间的同步。\n可以看到，用上面这种方式来创建进程比直接使用 fork 更简单易懂。现在，让我们看下输出结果：\nParent process 7170.\nProcess will start.\nRun child process test (10075)...\nProcess end.\n使用进程池创建多个进程\n在上面，我们只是创建了一个进程，如果要创建多个进程呢？Python 提供了进程池的方式，让我们批量创建子进程，让我们看一个简单的示例：\nimport os, time\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\ndef foo(x):\n    print &#39;Run task %s (pid:%s)...&#39;

5:\n            print &quot;write, %d&quot; % n\n            q.put(n)\n            time.sleep(1)\n            n += 1\n    except BaseException:\n        print &quot;write_task error&quot;\n    finally:\n        print &quot;write_task end&quot;\n\n# 从队列读取数据\ndef read_task(q):\n    try:\n        n = 1\n        while n &lt; 5:\n            print &quot;read, %d&quot; % q.get()\n            time.sleep(1)\n            n += 1\n    except BaseException:\n        print &quot;read_task error&quot;\n    finally:\n        print &quot;read_task end&quot;\n\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    q = Queue()  # 父进程创建Queue，并传给各个子进程\n\n    pw = Process(target=write_task, args=(q,))\n    pr = Process(target=read_task, args=(q,))\n\n    pw.start()   # 启动子进程 pw，写入\n    pr.start()   # 启动子进程 pr，读取\n    pw.join()    # 等待 pw 结束\n    pr.join()    # 等待 pr 结束\n    print &quot;DONE&quot;\n\n执行结果如下：\nwrite, 1\nread, 1\nwrite, 2\nread, 2\nwrite, 3\nread, 3\nwrite, 4\nread, 4\nwrite_task end\nread_task end\nDONE\n\n小结\n\n进程是正在运行的程序的实例。\n由于每个进程都有各自的内存空间，数据栈等，所以只能使用进程间通讯（Inter-Process Communication, IPC），而不能直接共享信息。\nPython 的 multiprocessing 模块封装了底层的实现机制，让我们可以更简单地编写多进程程序。\n\n参考资料\n\n多进程 - 廖雪峰的官方网站\nLinux下Fork与Exec使用 - hicjiajia - 博客园\nPython 中的进程、线程、协程、同步、异步、回调 - 七牛云存储 - SegmentFault\n编程中的进程、线程、协程、同步、异步、回调 · 浮生半日闲\npython中多进程以及多线程编程的总结 - Codefly\nmultithreading - Python multiprocessing.Pool: when to use apply, apply_async or map? - Stack Overflow\n\n"},"Process-Thread-Coroutine/thread.html":{"url":"Process-Thread-Coroutine/thread.html","title":"线程","body":"线程\n线程（thread）是进程（process）中的一个实体，一个进程至少包含一个线程。比如，对于视频播放器，显示视频用一个线程，播放音频用另一个线程。如果我们把进程看成一个容器，则线程是此容器的工作单位。\n进程和线程的区别主要有：\n\n进程之间是相互独立的，多进程中，同一个变量，各自有一份拷贝存在于每个进程中，但互不影响；而同一个进程的多个线程是内存共享的，所有变量都由所有线程共享；\n由于进程间是独立的，因此一个进程的崩溃不会影响到其他进程；而线程是包含在进程之内的，线程的崩溃就会引发进程的崩溃，继而导致同一进程内的其他线程也奔溃；\n\n多线程\n在 Python 中，进行多线程编程的模块有两个：thread 和 threading。其中，thread 是低级模块，threading 是高级模块，对 thread 进行了封装，一般来说，我们只需使用 threading 这个模块。\n下面，我们看一个简单的例子：\nfrom threading import Thread, current_thread\n\ndef thread_test(name):\n    print &#39;thread %s is running...&#39; % current_thread().name\n    print &#39;hello&#39;, name\n    print &#39;thread %s ended.&#39; % current_thread().name\n\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    print &#39;thread %s is running...&#39;

% current_thread().name\n\n可以看到，创建一个新的线程，就是把一个函数和函数参数传给 Thread 实例，然后调用 start 方法开始执行。代码中的 current_thread 用于返回当前线程的实例。\n执行结果如下：\nthread MainThread is running...\nhello world!\nthread TestThread is running...\nhello test\nthread TestThread ended.\nthread MainThread ended.\n锁\n由于同一个进程之间的线程是内存共享的，所以当多个线程对同一个变量进行修改的时候，就会得到意想不到的结果。\n让我们先看一个简单的例子：\nfrom threading import Thread, current_thread\n\nnum = 0\n\ndef calc():\n    global num\n    print &#39;thread %s is running...&#39;

% current_thread().name\n\n在上面的代码中，我们创建了 5 个线程，每个线程都对自己的局部变量 local_num 进行 10000 次的加 1 操作。由于对线程局部变量的修改不会影响到其他线程，因此，我们可以看到，每个线程结束时打印的 local_num 的值都为 10000，执行结果如下：\nthread MainThread is running...\nthread Thread-4 is running...\nThread-4 10000\nthread Thread-4 ended.\nthread Thread-5 is running...\nThread-5 10000\nthread Thread-5 ended.\nthread Thread-6 is running...\nThread-6 10000\nthread Thread-6 ended.\nthread Thread-7 is running...\nThread-7 10000\nthread Thread-7 ended.\nthread Thread-8 is running...\nThread-8 10000\nthread Thread-8 ended.\nthread MainThread ended.\n\n上面这种线程使用自己的局部变量的方法虽然可以避免多线程对同一变量的访问冲突，但还是有一些问题。在实际的开发中，我们会调用很多函数，每个函数又有很多个局部变量，这时每个函数都这么传参数显然是不可取的。\n为了解决这个问题，一个比较容易想到的做法就是创建一个全局字典，以线程的 ID 作为 key，线程的局部数据作为 value，这样就可以消除函数传参的问题，代码如下：\nfrom threading import Thread, current_thread\n\nglobal_dict = {}\n\ndef echo():\n    num = global_dict[current_thread()]    # 线程根据自己的 ID 获取数据\n    print current_thread().name, num\n\ndef calc():\n    print &#39;thread %s is running...&#39;

时，看看执行结果：\nEnter x: 3\nEnter y: &#39;a&#39;\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: &#39;int&#39; and &#39;str&#39;\nhello world\n\n捕捉未知异常\n事实上，在编写程序的时候，我们很难预料到程序的所有异常情况。比如，对于第一个例子，我们可以预料到一个 ZeroDivisionError 异常，如果细心一点，也会预料到一个 TypeError 异常，可是，还是有一些其他情况我们没有考虑到，比如在输入 x 的时候，我们直接按回车键，这时又会引发一个异常，程序也会随之挂掉：\nEnter x:      # 这里输入回车键\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\n  File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 0\n\n    ^\nSyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing\n\n那么，我们应该怎么在程序捕获某些难以预料的异常呢？我们在上文说过，Python 中所有的异常类都是从 BaseException 类派生的，也就是说，ZeroDivisionError、SyntaxError 等都是它的子类，因此，对于某些难以预料的异常，我们就可以使用 BaseException 来捕获，在大部分情况下，我们也可以使用 Exception 来捕获，因为 Exception 是大部分异常的父类，可以到这里查看所有异常类的继承关系。\n因此，对于第一个例子，我们可以把程序做一些修改，使其更加健壮：\ntry:\n    x = input(&#39;Enter x: &#39;)\n    y = input(&#39;Enter y: &#39;)\n    print x / y\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:      # 捕获 ZeroDivisionError 异常\n    print &#39;ZeroDivisionError:&#39;,e\nexcept TypeError as e:              # 捕获 TypeError 异常\n    print &#39;TypeError:&#39;,e\nexcept BaseException as e:          # 捕获其他异常\n    print &#39;BaseException:&#39;,e\n\nprint &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n注意到，我们把 BaseException 写在了最后一个 except 子句。如果你把它写在了第一个 except 子句，由于 BaseException 是所有异常的父类，那么程序的所有异常都会被第一个 except 子句捕获。\nelse 子句\n我们可以在 except 子句后面加一个 else 子句。当没有异常发生时，会自动执行 else 子句。\n对第一个例子，加入 else 子句：\ntry:\n    x = input(&#39;Enter x: &#39;)\n    y = input(&#39;Enter y: &#39;)\n    print x / y\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print &#39;ZeroDivisionError:&#39;,e\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print &#39;TypeError:&#39;,e\nexcept BaseException as e:\n    print &#39;BaseException:&#39;,e\nelse:\n    print &#39;no error!&#39;\n\nprint &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n看看执行结果：\nEnter x: 6\nEnter y: 2\n3\nno error!\nhello world\nfinally 子句\nfinally 子句不管有没有出现异常都会被执行。\n看看例子：\ntry:\n    x = 1/0\n    print x\nfinally:\n    print &#39;DONE&#39;\n\n执行结果：\nDONE\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\nZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero\n再看一个例子：\ntry:\n    x = 1/0\n    print x\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print &#39;ZeroDivisionError:&#39;,e\nfinally:\n    print &#39;DONE&#39;\n\n执行结果：\nZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero\nDONE\n使用 raise 手动引发异常\n有时，我们使用 except 捕获了异常，又想把异常抛出去，这时可以使用 raise 语句。\n看看例子：\ntry:\n    x = input(&#39;Enter x: &#39;)\n    y = input(&#39;Enter y: &#39;)\n    print x / y\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print &#39;ZeroDivisionError:&#39;,e\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print &#39;TypeError:&#39;,e\nexcept BaseException as e:\n    print &#39;BaseException:&#39;,e\n    raise                           # 使用 raise 抛出异常\nelse:\n    print &#39;no error!&#39;\n\nprint &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n运行上面代码，当 x 输入一个回车键时，错误会被打印出来，并被抛出：\nEnter x:    # 这里输入回车键\nBaseException: unexpected EOF while parsing (&lt;string&gt;, line 0)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\n  File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 0\n\n    ^\nSyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing\n\n上面的 raise 语句是不带参数的，它会把当前错误原样抛出。事实上，我们也创建自己的异常类，并抛出自定义的异常。\n创建自定义的异常类需要从 Exception 类继承，可以间接继承或直接继承，也就是可以继承其他的内建异常类。比如：\n# 自定义异常类\nclass SomeError(Exception):\n    pass\n\ntry:\n    x = input(&#39;Enter x: &#39;)\n    y = input(&#39;Enter y: &#39;)\n    print x / y\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print &#39;ZeroDivisionError:&#39;,e\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print &#39;TypeError:&#39;,e\nexcept BaseException as e:\n    print &#39;BaseException:&#39;,e\n    raise SomeError(&#39;invalid value&#39;)    # 抛出自定义的异常\nelse:\n    print &#39;no error!&#39;\n\nprint &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n运行上面代码，当 x 输入一个回车键时，错误被打印出来，并抛出我们自定义的异常：\nEnter x: \nBaseException: unexpected EOF while parsing (&lt;string&gt;, line 0)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSomeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-20-66060b472f91&gt;

m.span()\n(13, 15)\n\n再来看一个例子：\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nimport re\n\n# 将正则表达式编译成 Pattern 对象\npattern = re.compile(r&#39;\\d+&#39;) \n\n# 使用 search() 查找匹配的子串，不存在匹配的子串时将返回 None \n# 这里使用 match() 无法成功匹配 \nm = pattern.search(&#39;hello 123456 789&#39;) \n\nif m: \n    # 使用 Match 获得分组信息 \n    print &#39;matching string:&#39;,m.group()\n    print &#39;position:&#39;,m.span()\n\n执行结果：\nmatching string: 123456\nposition: (6, 12)\nfindall 方法\n上面的 match 和 search 方法都是一次匹配，只要找到了一个匹配的结果就返回。然而，在大多数时候，我们需要搜索整个字符串，获得所有匹配的结果。\nfindall 方法的使用形式如下：\nfindall(string[, pos[, endpos]])\n其中，string 是待匹配的字符串，pos 和 endpos 是可选参数，指定字符串的起始和终点位置，默认值分别是 0 和 len (字符串长度)。\nfindall 以列表形式返回全部能匹配的子串，如果没有匹配，则返回一个空列表。\n看看例子：\nimport re\n\npattern = re.compile(r&#39;\\d+&#39;)   # 查找数字\nresult1 = pattern.findall(&#39;hello 123456 789&#39;)\nresult2 = pattern.findall(&#39;one1two2three3four4&#39;, 0, 10)\n\nprint result1\nprint result2\n\n执行结果：\n[&#39;123456&#39;, &#39;789&#39;]\n[&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;]\nfinditer 方法\nfinditer 方法的行为跟 findall 的行为类似，也是搜索整个字符串，获得所有匹配的结果。但它返回一个顺序访问每一个匹配结果（Match 对象）的迭代器。\n看看例子：\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nimport re\n\npattern = re.compile(r&#39;\\d+&#39;)\n\nresult_iter1 = pattern.finditer(&#39;hello 123456 789&#39;)\nresult_iter2 = pattern.finditer(&#39;one1two2three3four4&#39;, 0, 10)\n\nprint type(result_iter1)\nprint type(result_iter2)\n\nprint &#39;result1...&#39;\nfor m1 in result_iter1:   # m1 是 Match 对象\n    print &#39;matching string: {}, position: {}&#39;.format(m1.group(), m1.span())\n\nprint &#39;result2...&#39;\nfor m2 in result_iter2:\n    print &#39;matching string: {}, position: {}&#39;.format(m2.group(), m2.span())\n\n执行结果：\n&lt;type &#39;callable-iterator&#39;&gt;\n&lt;type &#39;callable-iterator&#39;&gt;\nresult1...\nmatching string: 123456, position: (6, 12)\nmatching string: 789, position: (13, 16)\nresult2...\nmatching string: 1, position: (3, 4)\nmatching string: 2, position: (7, 8)\nsplit 方法\nsplit 方法按照能够匹配的子串将字符串分割后返回列表，它的使用形式如下：\nsplit(string[, maxsplit])\n其中，maxsplit 用于指定最大分割次数，不指定将全部分割。 \n看看例子：\nimport re\n\np = re.compile(r&#39;[\\s\\,\\;]+&#39;)\nprint p.split(&#39;a,b;; c   d&#39;)\n\n执行结果：\n[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;]\nsub 方法\nsub 方法用于替换。它的使用形式如下：\nsub(repl, string[, count])\n其中，repl 可以是字符串也可以是一个函数：\n\n如果 repl 是字符串，则会使用 repl 去替换字符串每一个匹配的子串，并返回替换后的字符串，另外，repl 还可以使用 \\id 的形式来引用分组，但不能使用编号 0；\n如果 repl 是函数，这个方法应当只接受一个参数（Match 对象），并返回一个字符串用于替换（返回的字符串中不能再引用分组）。 \n\ncount 用于指定最多替换次数，不指定时全部替换。 \n看看例子：\nimport re\n\np = re.compile(r&#39;(\\w+) (\\w+)&#39;)\ns = &#39;hello 123, hello 456&#39;\n\ndef func(m):\n    return &#39;hi&#39; + &#39; &#39; + m.group(2)\n\nprint p.sub(r&#39;hello world&#39;, s)  # 使用 &#39;hello world&#39; 替换 &#39;hello 123&#39; 和 &#39;hello 456&#39;\nprint p.sub(r&#39;\\2 \\1&#39;, s)        # 引用分组\nprint p.sub(func, s)\nprint p.sub(func, s, 1)         # 最多替换一次\n\n执行结果：\nhello world, hello world\n123 hello, 456 hello\nhi 123, hi 456\nhi 123, hello 456\nsubn 方法\nsubn 方法跟 sub 方法的行为类似，也用于替换。它的使用形式如下：\nsubn(repl, string[, count])\n它返回一个元组：\n(sub(repl, string[, count]), 替换次数)\n元组有两个元素，第一个元素是使用 sub 方法的结果，第二个元素返回原字符串被替换的次数。\n看看例子：\nimport re\n\np = re.compile(r&#39;(\\w+) (\\w+)&#39;)\ns = &#39;hello 123, hello 456&#39;\n\ndef func(m):\n    return &#39;hi&#39; + &#39; &#39; + m.group(2)\n\nprint p.subn(r&#39;hello world&#39;, s)\nprint p.subn(r&#39;\\2 \\1&#39;, s)\nprint p.subn(func, s)\nprint p.subn(func, s, 1)\n执行结果：\n(&#39;hello world, hello world&#39;, 2)\n(&#39;123 hello, 456 hello&#39;, 2)\n(&#39;hi 123, hi 456&#39;, 2)\n(&#39;hi 123, hello 456&#39;, 1)\n其他函数\n事实上，使用 compile 函数生成的 Pattern 对象的一系列方法跟 re 模块的多数函数是对应的，但在使用上有细微差别。\nmatch 函数\nmatch 函数的使用形式如下：\nre.match(pattern, string[, flags]):\n其中，pattern 是正则表达式的字符串形式，比如 \\d+, [a-z]+。\n而 Pattern 对象的 match 方法使用形式是：\nmatch(string[, pos[, endpos]])\n可以看到，match 函数不能指定字符串的区间，它只能搜索头部，看看例子：\nimport re\n\nm1 = re.match(r&#39;\\d+&#39;, &#39;One12twothree34four&#39;)\nif m1:\n    print &#39;matching string:&#39;,m1.group()\nelse:\n    print &#39;m1 is:&#39;,m1\n\nm2 = re.match(r&#39;\\d+&#39;, &#39;12twothree34four&#39;)\nif m2:\n    print &#39;matching string:&#39;, m2.group()\nelse:\n    print &#39;m2 is:&#39;,m2\n\n执行结果：\nm1 is: None\nmatching string: 12\nsearch 函数\nsearch 函数的使用形式如下：\nre.search(pattern, string[, flags])\nsearch 函数不能指定字符串的搜索区间，用法跟 Pattern 对象的 search 方法类似。\nfindall 函数\nfindall 函数的使用形式如下：\nre.findall(pattern, string[, flags])\nfindall 函数不能指定字符串的搜索区间，用法跟 Pattern 对象的 findall 方法类似。\n看看例子：\nimport re\n\nprint re.findall(r&#39;\\d+&#39;, &#39;hello 12345 789&#39;)\n\n# 输出\n[&#39;12345&#39;, &#39;789&#39;]\n\nfinditer 函数\nfinditer 函数的使用方法跟 Pattern 的 finditer 方法类似，形式如下：\nre.finditer(pattern, string[, flags])\nsplit 函数\nsplit 函数的使用形式如下：\nre.split(pattern, string[, maxsplit])\nsub 函数\nsub 函数的使用形式如下：\nre.sub(pattern, repl, string[, count])\nsubn 函数\nsubn 函数的使用形式如下：\nre.subn(pattern, repl, string[, count])\n到底用哪种方式\n从上文可以看到，使用 re 模块有两种方式：\n\n使用 re.compile 函数生成一个 Pattern 对象，然后使用 Pattern 对象的一系列方法对文本进行匹配查找；\n直接使用 re.match, re.search 和 re.findall 等函数直接对文本匹配查找；\n\n下面，我们用一个例子展示这两种方法。\n先看第 1 种用法：\nimport re\n\n# 将正则表达式先编译成 Pattern 对象\npattern = re.compile(r&#39;\\d+&#39;)\n\nprint pattern.match(&#39;123, 123&#39;)\nprint pattern.search(&#39;234, 234&#39;)\nprint pattern.findall(&#39;345, 345&#39;)\n\n再看第 2 种用法：\nimport re\n\nprint re.match(r&#39;\\d+&#39;, &#39;123, 123&#39;)\nprint re.search(r&#39;\\d+&#39;, &#39;234, 234&#39;)\nprint re.findall(r&#39;\\d+&#39;, &#39;345, 345&#39;)\n\n如果一个正则表达式需要用到多次（比如上面的 \\d+），在多种场合经常需要被用到，出于效率的考虑，我们应该预先编译该正则表达式，生成一个 Pattern 对象，再使用该对象的一系列方法对需要匹配的文件进行匹配；而如果直接使用 re.match, re.search 等函数，每次传入一个正则表达式，它都会被编译一次，效率就会大打折扣。\n因此，我们推荐使用第 1 种用法。\n匹配中文\n在某些情况下，我们想匹配文本中的汉字，有一点需要注意的是，中文的 unicode 编码范围 主要在 [\\u4e00-\\u9fa5]，这里说主要是因为这个范围并不完整，比如没有包括全角（中文）标点，不过，在大部分情况下，应该是够用的。\n假设现在想把字符串 title = u&#39;你好，hello，世界&#39; 中的中文提取出来，可以这么做：\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nimport re\n\ntitle = u&#39;你好，hello，世界&#39;\npattern = re.compile(ur&#39;[\\u4e00-\\u9fa5]+&#39;)\nresult = pattern.findall(title)\n\nprint result\n\n注意到，我们在正则表达式前面加上了两个前缀 ur，其中 r 表示使用原始字符串，u 表示是 unicode 字符串。\n执行结果:\n[u&#39;\\u4f60\\u597d&#39;, u&#39;\\u4e16\\u754c&#39;]\n贪婪匹配\n在 Python 中，正则匹配默认是贪婪匹配（在少数语言中可能是非贪婪），也就是匹配尽可能多的字符。\n比如，我们想找出字符串中的所有 div 块：\nimport re\n\ncontent = &#39;aa&lt;div&gt;test1&lt;/div&gt;bb&lt;div&gt;test2&lt;/div&gt;cc&#39;\npattern = re.compile(r&#39;&lt;div&gt;.*&lt;/div&gt;&#39;)\nresult = pattern.findall(content)\n\nprint result\n\n执行结果：\n[&#39;&lt;div&gt;test1&lt;/div&gt;bb&lt;div&gt;test2&lt;/div&gt;&#39;]\n由于正则匹配是贪婪匹配，也就是尽可能多的匹配，因此，在成功匹配到第一个 &lt;/div&gt; 时，它还会向右尝试匹配，查看是否还有更长的可以成功匹配的子串。\n如果我们想非贪婪匹配，可以加一个 ?，如下：\nimport re\n\ncontent = &#39;aa&lt;div&gt;test1&lt;/div&gt;bb&lt;div&gt;test2&lt;/div&gt;cc&#39;\npattern = re.compile(r&#39;&lt;div&gt;.*?&lt;/div&gt;&#39;)    # 加上 ?\nresult = pattern.findall(content)\n\nprint result\n\n结果：\n[&#39;&lt;div&gt;test1&lt;/div&gt;&#39;, &#39;&lt;div&gt;test2&lt;/div&gt;&#39;]\n小结\n\nre 模块的一般使用步骤如下：\n使用 compile 函数将正则表达式的字符串形式编译为一个 Pattern 对象；\n通过 Pattern 对象提供的一系列方法对文本进行匹配查找，获得匹配结果（一个 Match 对象）；\n最后使用 Match 对象提供的属性和方法获得信息，根据需要进行其他的操作；\n\n\nPython 的正则匹配默认是贪婪匹配。\n\n参考资料\n\nPython正则表达式指南\n正则表达式 - 廖雪峰的官方网站\n\n"},"HTTP/":{"url":"HTTP/","title":"HTTP 服务","body":"HTTP 服务\n本章主要介绍：\n\nHTTP 协议\nRequests 库的使用\n\n"},"HTTP/HTTP.html":{"url":"HTTP/HTTP.html","title":"HTTP 协议简介","body":"HTTP 协议简介\nHTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol, 超文本传输协议)是互联网上应用最为广泛的一种网络协议，它是基于 TCP 的应用层协议，简单地说就是客户端和服务器进行通信的一种规则，它的模式非常简单，就是客户端发起请求，服务器响应请求，如下图所示：\n\nHTTP 最早于 1991 年发布，是 0.9 版，不过目前该版本已不再用。HTTP 目前在使用的版本主要有：\n\nHTTP/1.0，于 1996 年 5 月发布，引入了多种功能，至今仍在使用当中。\nHTTP/1.1，于 1997 年 1 月发布，持久连接被默认采用，是目前最流行的版本。\nHTTP/2 ，于 2015 年 5 月发布，引入了服务器推送等多种功能，是目前最新的版本。\n\nHTTP 请求\nHTTP 请求由三部分组成：\n\n请求行：包含请求方法、请求地址和 HTTP 协议版本\n消息报头：包含一系列的键值对\n请求正文（可选）：注意和消息报头之间有一个空行\n\n如图所示：\n\n下面是一个 HTTP GET 请求的例子：\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: httpbin.org\nConnection: keep-alive\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh;

print r.url\nhttp://httpbin.org/get?per_page=10&amp;page=1\n\n需要注意的是字典里值为 None 的键不会被添加到 URL 的查询字符串中。\nPOST 请求\n使用 Requests 发送 POST 请求也很简单，如下：\nimport requests\n\nr = requests.post(&quot;http://httpbin.org/post&quot;)\n\n通常，我们在发送 POST 请求时还会附上数据，比如发送编码为表单形式的数据或编码为 JSON 形式的数据，这时，我们可以使用  Requests 提供的 data 参数。\n\n发送编码为表单形式的数据\n\n通过给 data 参数传递一个 dict，我们的数据字典在发出请求时会被自动编码为表单形式，比如：\nimport requests\n\npayload = {&#39;page&#39;: 1, &#39;per_page&#39;: 10}\nr = requests.post(&quot;http://httpbin.org/post&quot;, data=payload)\n\n看看返回的内容（省略了部分数据）：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print r.text\n{\n  ...\n  &quot;form&quot;: {\n    &quot;page&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, \n    &quot;per_page&quot;: &quot;10&quot;\n  }, \n  ...\n}\n\n\n发送编码为 JSON 形式的数据\n\n如果给 data 参数传递一个 string，我们的数据会被直接发布出去，比如：\nimport json\nimport requests\n\npayload = {&#39;page&#39;: 1, &#39;per_page&#39;: 10}\nr = requests.post(&quot;http://httpbin.org/post&quot;, data=json.dumps(payload))\n\n看看返回：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print r.text\n{\n  &quot;args&quot;: {}, \n  &quot;data&quot;: &quot;{\\&quot;per_page\\&quot;: 10, \\&quot;page\\&quot;: 1}&quot;, \n  &quot;files&quot;: {}, \n  &quot;form&quot;: {}, \n  &quot;headers&quot;: {\n    &quot;Accept&quot;: &quot;*/*&quot;, \n    &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;: &quot;gzip, deflate&quot;, \n    &quot;Content-Length&quot;: &quot;27&quot;, \n    &quot;Host&quot;: &quot;httpbin.org&quot;, \n    &quot;User-Agent&quot;: &quot;python-requests/2.9.1&quot;\n  }, \n  &quot;json&quot;: {\n    &quot;page&quot;: 1, \n    &quot;per_page&quot;: 10\n  }, \n  &quot;origin&quot;: &quot;13.75.42.240&quot;, \n  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://httpbin.org/post&quot;\n}\n\n在上面，我们自行对 dict 进行了编码，这种方式等价于使用 json 参数，而给它传递 dict，如下：\nimport requests\n\npayload = {&#39;page&#39;: 1, &#39;per_page&#39;: 10}\nr = requests.post(&quot;http://httpbin.org/post&quot;, json=payload)\n\n这种做法跟上面的做法是等价的，数据在发出时会被自动编码。\n请求头\n有时，我们需要为请求添加 HTTP 头部，我们可以通过传递一个 dict 给 headers 参数来实现。比如：\nimport requests\n\nurl = &#39;http://httpbin.org/post&#39;\npayload = {&#39;page&#39;: 1, &#39;per_page&#39;: 10}\nheaders = {&#39;User-Agent&#39;: &#39;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT)&#39;}\n\nr = requests.post(&quot;http://httpbin.org/post&quot;, json=payload, headers=headers)\n\n发送到服务器的请求的头部可以通过 r.request.headers 访问：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print r.request.headers\n{&#39;Content-Length&#39;: &#39;27&#39;, &#39;Accept-Encoding&#39;: &#39;gzip, deflate&#39;, &#39;Accept&#39;: &#39;*/*&#39;, &#39;User-Agent&#39;: &#39;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT)&#39;, &#39;Connection&#39;: &#39;keep-alive&#39;, &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;}\n服务器返回给我们的响应头部信息可以通过 r.headers 访问：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print r.headers\n{&#39;Content-Length&#39;: &#39;462&#39;, &#39;Server&#39;: &#39;nginx&#39;, &#39;Connection&#39;: &#39;close&#39;, &#39;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&#39;: &#39;true&#39;, &#39;Date&#39;: &#39;Mon, 05 Dec 2016 15:41:05 GMT&#39;, &#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39;: &#39;*&#39;, &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;}\nHTTP 响应\nHTTP 响应与 HTTP 请求相似，由三部分组成：\n\n状态行：包含 HTTP 协议版本、状态码和状态描述，以空格分隔\n响应头：包含一系列的键值对\n响应正文\n\n如图所示：\n\n当我们使用 requests.* 发送请求时，Requests 做了两件事：\n\n构建一个 Request 对象，该对象会根据请求方法或相关参数发起 HTTP 请求\n一旦服务器返回响应，就会产生一个 Response 对象，该响应对象包含服务器返回的所有信息，也包含你原来创建的 Request 对象\n\n对于响应状态码，我们可以访问响应对象的 status_code 属性：\nimport requests\n\nr = requests.get(&quot;http://httpbin.org/get&quot;)\nprint r.status_code\n\n# 输出\n200\n\n对于响应正文，我们可以通过多种方式读取，比如：\n\n普通响应，使用 r.text 获取\nJSON 响应，使用 r.json() 获取\n二进制响应，使用 r.content 获取\n原始响应，使用 r.raw 获取\n\n普通响应\n我们可以使用 r.text 来读取 unicode 形式的响应，看看例子：\nimport requests\n\nr = requests.get(&quot;https://github.com/timeline.json&quot;)\nprint r.text\nprint r.encoding\n\n# 输出\n{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Hello there, wayfaring stranger. If you’re reading this then you probably didn’t see our blog post a couple of years back announcing that this API would go away: http://git.io/17AROg Fear not, you should be able to get what you need from the shiny new Events API instead.&quot;,&quot;documentation_url&quot;:&quot;https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/#list-public-events&quot;}\nutf-8\n\nRequests 会自动解码来自服务器的内容，大多数 unicode 字符集都能被正确解码。\nJSON 响应\n对于 JSON 响应的内容，我们可以使用 json() 方法把返回的数据解析成 Python 对象。\n看看例子：\nimport requests\n\nr = requests.get(&quot;https://github.com/timeline.json&quot;)\n\nif r.status_code == 200:\n    print r.headers.get(&#39;content-type&#39;)\n    print r.json()\n\n# 输出\napplication/json; charset=utf-8\n{u&#39;documentation_url&#39;: u&#39;https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/#list-public-events&#39;, u&#39;message&#39;: u&#39;Hello there, wayfaring stranger. If you\\u2019re reading this then you probably didn\\u2019t see our blog post a couple of years back announcing that this API would go away: http://git.io/17AROg Fear not, you should be able to get what you need from the shiny new Events API instead.&#39;}\n\n如果 JSON 解码失败，r.json() 就会抛出异常，比如：\nimport requests\n\nr = requests.get(&quot;https://www.baidu.com&quot;)\n\nif r.status_code == 200:\n    print r.headers.get(&#39;content-type&#39;)\n    print r.json()\n\n# 输出\ntext/html\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-3-9216431f0e2d&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()\n      1 if r.status_code == 200:\n      2     print r.headers.get(&#39;content-type&#39;)\n----&gt; 3     print r.json()\n      4\n....\n....\nValueError: No JSON object could be decoded\n\n二进制响应\n我们也可以以字节的方式访问响应正文，访问 content 属性可以获取二进制数据，比如用返回的二进制数据创建一张图片：\nimport requests\n\nurl = &#39;https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/logo/logo.png?raw=true&#39;\nr = requests.get(url)\nimage_data = r.content   # 获取二进制数据\n\nwith open(&#39;/Users/Ethan/Downloads/redux.png&#39;, &#39;wb&#39;) as fout:\n    fout.write(image_data)\n\n原始响应\n在少数情况下，我们可能想获取来自服务器的原始套接字响应，这可以通过访问响应对象的 raw 属性来实现，但要确保在初始请求中设置了 stream=True，比如：\nimport requests\n\nurl = &#39;https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/logo/logo.png?raw=true&#39;\nr = requests.get(url, stream=True)\nprint r.raw\nr.raw.read(10)\n\n# 输出\n&lt;requests.packages.urllib3.response.HTTPResponse object at 0x1113b0a90&gt;\n&#39;\\x89PNG\\r\\n\\x1a\\n\\x00\\x00&#39;\n\n重定向\n默认情况下，除了 HEAD，Requests 会自动处理所有重定向。我们可以使用响应对象的 history 属性来追踪重定向，Response.history 是一个 Response 对象的列表，这个对象列表按照从最老到最近的请求进行排序。\n比如，点击某些网站的链接，它会将页面重定向到其他网站：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; headers = {&#39;User-Agent&#39;: &#39;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT)&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get(&#39;https://toutiao.io/shares/789751/url&#39;, headers=headers)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.status_code\n200\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.url   # 发生了重定向，响应对象的 url，跟请求对象不一样\nu&#39;https://funhacks.net/2016/12/06/flask_react_news/?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io&#39;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.history\n[&lt;Response [302]&gt;, &lt;Response [302]&gt;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.history[0].text\nu&#39;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://toutiao.io/k/fsntvg&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#39;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.history[1].text\nu&#39;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://funhacks.net/2016/12/06/flask_react_news/?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;amp;utm_source=toutiao.io&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#39;\n\n可以看到，我们访问网址 https://toutiao.io/shares/789751/url 被重定向到了下面的链接：\nu&#39;https://funhacks.net/2016/12/06/flask_react_news/?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io&#39;\n\n我们还看到 r.history 包含了两个 Response 对象列表，我们可以用它来追踪重定向。\n如果请求方法是 GET、POST、PUT、OPTIONS、PATCH 或 DELETE，我们可以通过 all_redirects 参数禁止重定向：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; headers = {&#39;User-Agent&#39;: &#39;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT)&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get(&#39;https://toutiao.io/shares/789751/url&#39;, headers=headers, allow_redirects=False)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.status_code\n200\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.url    # 禁止重定向，响应对象的 url 跟请求对象一致\nu&#39;https://toutiao.io/shares/789751/url&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.history\n[]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.text\nu&#39;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://toutiao.io/k/fsntvg&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#39;\n\nCookie\n\n如果某个响应包含一些 cookie，我们可以直接访问它们，比如：\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; url = &#39;http://exmaple.com/some/cookie/setting/url&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get(url)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.cookies[&#39;some_key&#39;]\n&#39;some_value&#39;\n\n\n发送 cookies 到服务器，可以使用 cookies 参数：\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; url = &#39;http://httpbin.org/cookies&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cookies = dict(key1=&#39;value1&#39;)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.text\nu&#39;{\\n  &quot;cookies&quot;: {\\n    &quot;key1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;\\n  }\\n}\\n&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print r.text\n{\n  &quot;cookies&quot;: {\n    &quot;key1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;\n  }\n}\n\n会话对象\n我们知道，HTTP 协议是无状态的，这意味着每个请求都是独立的，如果后续的处理需要用到前面的信息，则数据需要重传，为了解决这个问题，我们可以使用 Cookie 或 Session 来存储某些特定的信息，比如用户名、密码等，这样，当用户在不同 Web 页面跳转或再次登录网站时，就不用重新输入用户名和密码（当然，如果 Cookie 被删除和 Session 过期则需要重新输入）。\nRequests 提供了会话对象让我们能够跨请求保持某些参数，也可以在同一个 Session 实例发出的所有请求之间保持 Cookie。\n下面，我们看看会话对象的使用。\n下面是一个跨请求保持 Cookie 的例子：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = requests.Session()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.get(&#39;http://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789&#39;)\n&lt;Response [200]&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = s.get(&quot;http://httpbin.org/cookies&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print r.text\n{\n  &quot;cookies&quot;: {\n    &quot;sessioncookie&quot;: &quot;123456789&quot;\n  }\n}\n\n会话还可用来为请求方法提供缺省数据，通过设置会话对象的属性来实现：\nimport requests\n\ns = requests.Session()\ns.auth = (&#39;user&#39;, &#39;pass&#39;)\ns.headers.update({&#39;x-test&#39;: &#39;true&#39;})\n\n# x-test 和 x-test2 都会被发送\ns.get(&#39;http://httpbin.org/headers&#39;, headers={&#39;x-test2&#39;: &#39;true&#39;})\n\n代理\nRequests 支持基本的 HTTP 代理 和 SOCKS 代理（2.10.0 新增功能）。\nHTTP 代理\n如果需要使用 HTTP 代理，我们可以为任意请求方法提供 proxies 参数，如下：\nimport requests\n\nproxies = {\n  &quot;http&quot;: &quot;http://10.10.1.10:3128&quot;,\n  &quot;https&quot;: &quot;http://10.10.1.10:1080&quot;,\n}\n\nrequests.get(&quot;http://example.org&quot;, proxies=proxies)\n\n我们也可以通过设置环境变量 HTTP_PROXY 和 HTTPS_PROXY 来配置代理：\n$ export HTTP_PROXY=&quot;http://10.10.1.10:3128&quot;\n$ export HTTPS_PROXY=&quot;http://10.10.1.10:1080&quot;\n\n$ python\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests\n&gt;&gt;&gt; requests.get(&quot;http://example.org&quot;)\n\nSOCKS 代理\nRequess 自 2.10.0 版起，开始支持 SOCKS 协议的代理，如果要使用，我们还需安装一个第三方库：\n$ pip install requests[socks]\nSOCKS 代理的使用和 HTTP 代理类似：\nimport requests\n\nproxies = {\n  &quot;http&quot;: &quot;socks5://user:pass@host:port&quot;,\n  &quot;https&quot;: &quot;socks5://user:pass@host:port&quot;,\n}\n\nrequests.get(&quot;http://example.org&quot;, proxies=proxies)\n\n身份认证\n大部分 Web 服务都需要身份认证，并且有多种不同的认证类型，比如：\n\n基本身份认证\n摘要式身份认证\nOAuth 认证\n\n下面介绍一下基本身份认证和 OAuth 认证。\n基本身份认证\n基本身份认证（HTTP Basic Auth）是最简单的一种身份认证，一般需要身份认证的 Web 服务也都接受 HTTP Basic Auth，Requests 提供了非常简单的形式让我们使用 HTTP Basic Auth:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth\n&gt;&gt;&gt; requests.get(&#39;https://api.github.com/user&#39;, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(&#39;user&#39;, &#39;pass&#39;))\n\n由于 HTTP Basic Auth 非常常见，Requests 提供了一种简写的形式：\nrequests.get(&#39;https://api.github.com/user&#39;, auth=(&#39;user&#39;, &#39;pass&#39;))\n\nOAuth 2 认证\nOAuth 是一种常见的 Web API 认证方式，目前的版本是 2.0。Requests 并不直接支持 OAuth 认证，而是要配合另外一个库一起使用，该库是 requests-oauthlib。\n下面以 GitHub 为例，介绍一下 OAuth 2 认证。\n&gt;&gt;&gt; # Credentials you get from registering a new application\n&gt;&gt;&gt; client_id = &#39;&lt;the id you get from github&gt;&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; client_secret = &#39;&lt;the secret you get from github&gt;&#39;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; # OAuth endpoints given in the GitHub API documentation\n&gt;&gt;&gt; authorization_base_url = &#39;https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; token_url = &#39;https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token&#39;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

from collections import Counter\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;aaaabbbccd&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Counter(s)        # 创建了一个 Counter 对象\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c                     \nCounter({&#39;a&#39;: 4, &#39;b&#39;: 3, &#39;c&#39;: 2, &#39;d&#39;: 1})\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

from collections import Counter\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = &#39;aaaabbbccd&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c1 = Counter(s1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c1\nCounter({&#39;a&#39;: 4, &#39;b&#39;: 3, &#39;c&#39;: 2, &#39;d&#39;: 1})\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

c1 - c2       # c2 相对于 c1 的差集\nCounter({&#39;c&#39;: 2, &#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 1, &#39;d&#39;: 1})\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c1 &amp; c2       # c1 和 c2 的交集\nCounter({&#39;a&#39;: 3, &#39;b&#39;: 2})\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c1 | c2       # c1 和 c2 的并集\nCounter({&#39;a&#39;: 4, &#39;b&#39;: 3, &#39;c&#39;: 2, &#39;e&#39;: 1, &#39;d&#39;: 1, &#39;f&#39;: 1})\n\nOrderedDict\nPython 中的 dict 是无序的：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dict([(&#39;a&#39;, 10), (&#39;b&#39;, 20), (&#39;c&#39;, 15)])\n{&#39;a&#39;: 10, &#39;c&#39;: 15, &#39;b&#39;: 20}\n\n有时，我们希望保持 key 的顺序，这时可以用 OrderedDict：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import OrderedDict\n&gt;&gt;&gt; OrderedDict([(&#39;a&#39;, 10), (&#39;b&#39;, 20), (&#39;c&#39;, 15)])\nOrderedDict([(&#39;a&#39;, 10), (&#39;b&#39;, 20), (&#39;c&#39;, 15)])\n\ndefaultdict\n在 Python 中使用 dict 时，如果访问了不存在的 key，会抛出 KeyError 异常，因此，在访问之前，我们经常需要对 key 作判断，比如：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;aaabbc&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for char in s:\n...     if char in d:\n...         d[char] += 1\n...     else:\n...         d[char] = 1\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\n{&#39;a&#39;: 3, &#39;c&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2}\n\n使用 defaultdict，我们可以给字典中的 key 提供一个默认值。访问 defaultdict 中的 key，如果 key 存在，就返回 key 对应的 value，如果 key 不存在，就返回默认值。\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import defaultdict\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = defaultdict(int)   # 默认的 value 值是 0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;aaabbc&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for char in s:\n...     d[char] += 1\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d\ndefaultdict(&lt;type &#39;int&#39;&gt;, {&#39;a&#39;: 3, &#39;c&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2})\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d.get(&#39;a&#39;)\n3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d[&#39;z&#39;]\n0\n\n使用 defaultdict 时，我们可以传入一个工厂方法来指定默认值，比如传入 int，表示默认值是 0，传入 list，表示默认是 []：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import defaultdict\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = defaultdict(int)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d1[&#39;a&#39;]\n0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = defaultdict(list)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d2[&#39;b&#39;]\n[]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d3 = defaultdict(str)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d3[&#39;a&#39;]\n&#39;&#39;\n\n我们还可以自定义默认值，通过 lambda 函数来实现：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import defaultdict\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = defaultdict(lambda: 10)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d[&#39;a&#39;]\n10\n\nnamedtuple\n我们经常用 tuple (元组) 来表示一个不可变对象，比如用一个 (姓名, 学号, 年龄) 的元组来表示一个学生：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stu = (&#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;001&#39;, 20)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stu[0]\n&#39;ethan&#39;\n\n这里使用 tuple 没什么问题，但可读性比较差，我们必须清楚索引代表的含义，比如索引 0 表示姓名，索引 1 表示学号。如果用类来定义，就可以通过设置属性 name, id, age 来表示，但就有些小题大作了。\n我们可以通过 namedtuple 为元组的每个索引设置名称，然后通过「属性名」来访问：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import namedtuple\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Student = namedtuple(&#39;Student&#39;, [&#39;name&#39;, &#39;id&#39;, &#39;age&#39;])  # 定义了一个 Student 元组\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stu = Student(&#39;ethan&#39;, &#39;001&#39;, 20)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stu.name\n&#39;ethan&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stu.id\n&#39;001&#39;\n\ndeque\ndeque 是双端队列，允许我们在队列两端添加或删除元素。\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import deque\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; q = deque([&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;])\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

from tasks import add\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add.delay(2, 8)\n&lt;AsyncResult: 2272ddce-8be5-493f-b5ff-35a0d9fe600f&gt;\n\n在上面，我们从 tasks.py 文件中导入了 add 任务对象，然后使用 delay() 方法将任务发送到消息中间件（Broker），Celery Worker 进程监控到该任务后，就会进行执行。我们将窗口切换到 Worker 的启动窗口，会看到多了两条日志：\n[2016-12-10 12:00:50,376: INFO/MainProcess] Received task: tasks.add[2272ddce-8be5-493f-b5ff-35a0d9fe600f]\n[2016-12-10 12:00:55,385: INFO/PoolWorker-4] Task tasks.add[2272ddce-8be5-493f-b5ff-35a0d9fe600f] succeeded in 5.00642602402s: 10\n这说明任务已经被调度并执行成功。\n另外，我们如果想获取执行后的结果，可以这样做：\n&gt;&gt;&gt; result = add.delay(2, 6)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; result.ready()   # 使用 ready() 判断任务是否执行完毕\nFalse\n&gt;&gt;&gt; result.ready()\nFalse\n&gt;&gt;&gt; result.ready()\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; result.get()     # 使用 get() 获取任务结果\n8\n\n在上面，我们是在 Python 的环境中调用任务。事实上，我们通常在应用程序中调用任务。比如，将下面的代码保存为 client.py:\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom tasks import add\n\n# 异步任务\nadd.delay(2, 8)\n\nprint &#39;hello world&#39;\n\n运行命令 $ python client.py，可以看到，虽然任务函数 add 需要等待 5 秒才返回执行结果，但由于它是一个异步任务，不会阻塞当前的主程序，因此主程序会往下执行 print 语句，打印出结果。\n使用配置\n在上面的例子中，我们直接把 Broker 和 Backend 的配置写在了程序当中，更好的做法是将配置项统一写入到一个配置文件中，通常我们将该文件命名为 celeryconfig.py。Celery 的配置比较多，可以在官方文档查询每个配置项的含义。\n下面，我们再看一个例子。项目结构如下：\ncelery_demo                    # 项目根目录\n    ├── celery_app             # 存放 celery 相关文件\n    │   ├── __init__.py\n    │   ├── celeryconfig.py    # 配置文件\n    │   ├── task1.py           # 任务文件 1\n    │   └── task2.py           # 任务文件 2\n    └── client.py              # 应用程序\n__init__.py 代码如下：\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom celery import Celery\n\napp = Celery(&#39;demo&#39;)                                # 创建 Celery 实例\napp.config_from_object(&#39;celery_app.celeryconfig&#39;)   # 通过 Celery 实例加载配置模块\n\nceleryconfig.py 代码如下：\nBROKER_URL = &#39;redis://127.0.0.1:6379&#39;

% name)\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    hello()\n\n在上面的例子中，函数 hello 有两个参数：count 和 name，它们的值从命令行中获取。\n\n@click.command() 使函数 hello 成为命令行接口；\n@click.option 的第一个参数指定了命令行选项的名称，不难猜到，count 的默认值是 1，name 的值从输入获取；\n使用 click.echo 进行输出是为了获得更好的兼容性，因为 print 在 Python2 和 Python3 的用法有些差别。\n\n看看执行情况：\n$ python hello.py\nYour name: Ethan           # 这里会显示 &#39;Your name: &#39;(对应代码中的 prompt)，接受用户输入\nHello Ethan!\n\n$ python hello.py --help   # click 帮我们自动生成了 `--help` 用法\nUsage: hello.py [OPTIONS]\n\n  Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times.\n\nOptions:\n  --count INTEGER  Number of greetings.\n  --name TEXT      The person to greet.\n  --help           Show this message and exit.\n\n$ python hello.py --count 3 --name Ethan    # 指定 count 和 name 的值\nHello Ethan!\nHello Ethan!\nHello Ethan!\n\n$ python hello.py --count=3 --name=Ethan    # 也可以使用 `=`，和上面等价\nHello Ethan!\nHello Ethan!\nHello Ethan!\n\n$ python hello.py --name=Ethan              # 没有指定 count，默认值是 1\nHello Ethan!\noption\noption 最基本的用法就是通过指定命令行选项的名称，从命令行读取参数值，再将其传递给函数。在上面的例子，我们看到，除了设置命令行选项的名称，我们还会指定默认值，help 说明等，option 常用的设置参数如下：\n\ndefault: 设置命令行参数的默认值\nhelp: 参数说明\ntype: 参数类型，可以是 string, int, float 等\nprompt: 当在命令行中没有输入相应的参数时，会根据 prompt 提示用户输入\nnargs: 指定命令行参数接收的值的个数\n\n下面，我们再看看相关的例子。\n指定 type\n我们可以使用 type 来指定参数类型：\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.option(&#39;--rate&#39;, type=float, help=&#39;rate&#39;)   # 指定 rate 是 float 类型\ndef show(rate):\n    click.echo(&#39;rate: %s&#39; % rate)\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    show()\n\n执行情况：\n$ python click_type.py --rate 1\nrate: 1.0\n$ python click_type.py --rate 0.66\nrate: 0.66\n可选值\n在某些情况下，一个参数的值只能是某些可选的值，如果用户输入了其他值，我们应该提示用户输入正确的值。在这种情况下，我们可以通过 click.Choice() 来限定：\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.option(&#39;--gender&#39;, type=click.Choice([&#39;man&#39;, &#39;woman&#39;]))    # 限定值\ndef choose(gender):\n    click.echo(&#39;gender: %s&#39; % gender)\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    choose()\n\n执行情况：\n$ python click_choice.py --gender boy\nUsage: click_choice.py [OPTIONS]\n\nError: Invalid value for &quot;--gender&quot;: invalid choice: boy. (choose from man, woman)\n\n$ python click_choice.py --gender man\ngender: man\n多值参数\n有时，一个参数需要接收多个值。option 支持设置固定长度的参数值，通过 nargs 指定。\n看看例子就明白了：\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.option(&#39;--center&#39;, nargs=2, type=float, help=&#39;center of the circle&#39;)\n@click.option(&#39;--radius&#39;, type=float, help=&#39;radius of the circle&#39;)\ndef circle(center, radius):\n    click.echo(&#39;center: %s, radius: %s&#39; % (center, radius))\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    circle()\n\n在上面的例子中，option 指定了两个参数：center 和 radius，其中，center 表示二维平面上一个圆的圆心坐标，接收两个值，以元组的形式将值传递给函数，而 radius 表示圆的半径。\n执行情况：\n$ python click_multi_values.py --center 3 4 --radius 10\ncenter: (3.0, 4.0), radius: 10.0\n\n$ python click_multi_values.py --center 3 4 5 --radius 10\nUsage: click_multi_values.py [OPTIONS]\n\nError: Got unexpected extra argument (5)\n输入密码\n有时，在输入密码的时候，我们希望能隐藏显示。option 提供了两个参数来设置密码的输入：hide_input 和 confirmation_promt，其中，hide_input 用于隐藏输入，confirmation_promt 用于重复输入。\n看看例子：\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.option(&#39;--password&#39;, prompt=True, hide_input=True, confirmation_prompt=True)\ndef input_password(password):\n    click.echo(&#39;password: %s&#39; % password)\n\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    input_password()\n\n执行情况：\n$ python click_password.py\nPassword:                         # 不会显示密码\nRepeat for confirmation:          # 重复一遍\npassword: 666666\n由于上面的写法有点繁琐，click 也提供了一种快捷的方式，通过使用 @click.password_option()，上面的代码可以简写成：\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.password_option()\ndef input_password(password):\n    click.echo(&#39;password: %s&#39; % password)\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    input_password()\n\n改变命令行程序的执行\n有些参数会改变命令行程序的执行，比如在终端输入 python 是进入 python 控制台，而输入 python --version 是打印 python 版本。Click 提供 eager 标识对参数名进行标识，如果输入该参数，则会拦截既定的命令行执行流程，跳转去执行一个回调函数。\n让我们看看例子：\nimport click\n\ndef print_version(ctx, param, value):\n    if not value or ctx.resilient_parsing:\n        return\n    click.echo(&#39;Version 1.0&#39;)\n    ctx.exit()\n\n@click.command()\n@click.option(&#39;--version&#39;, is_flag=True, callback=print_version,\n              expose_value=False, is_eager=True)\n@click.option(&#39;--name&#39;, default=&#39;Ethan&#39;, help=&#39;name&#39;)\ndef hello(name):\n    click.echo(&#39;Hello %s!&#39; % name)\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    hello()\n\n其中：\n\nis_eager=True 表明该命令行选项优先级高于其他选项；\nexpose_value=False 表示如果没有输入该命令行选项，会执行既定的命令行流程；\ncallback 指定了输入该命令行选项时，要跳转执行的函数；\n\n执行情况：\n$ python click_eager.py\nHello Ethan!\n\n$ python click_eager.py --version                   # 拦截既定的命令行执行流程\nVersion 1.0\n\n$ python click_eager.py --name Michael\nHello Michael!\n\n$ python click_eager.py --version --name Ethan      # 忽略 name 选项\nVersion 1.0\nargument\n我们除了使用 @click.option 来添加可选参数，还会经常使用 @click.argument 来添加固定参数。它的使用和 option 类似，但支持的功能比 option 少。\n入门使用\n下面是一个简单的例子：\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.argument(&#39;coordinates&#39;)\ndef show(coordinates):\n    click.echo(&#39;coordinates: %s&#39; % coordinates)\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    show()\n\n看看执行情况：\n$ python click_argument.py                     # 错误，缺少参数 coordinates\nUsage: click_argument.py [OPTIONS] COORDINATES\n\nError: Missing argument &quot;coordinates&quot;.\n\n$ python click_argument.py --help              # argument 指定的参数在 help 中没有显示\nUsage: click_argument.py [OPTIONS] COORDINATES\n\nOptions:\n  --help  Show this message and exit.\n\n$ python click_argument.py --coordinates 10    # 错误用法，这是 option 参数的用法\nError: no such option: --coordinates\n\n$ python click_argument.py 10                  # 正确，直接输入值即可\ncoordinates: 10\n\n多个 argument\n我们再来看看多个 argument 的例子：\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.argument(&#39;x&#39;)\n@click.argument(&#39;y&#39;)\n@click.argument(&#39;z&#39;)\ndef show(x, y, z):\n    click.echo(&#39;x: %s, y: %s, z:%s&#39; % (x, y, z))\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    show()\n\n执行情况：\n$ python click_argument.py 10 20 30\nx: 10, y: 20, z:30\n\n$ python click_argument.py 10\nUsage: click_argument.py [OPTIONS] X Y Z\n\nError: Missing argument &quot;y&quot;.\n\n$ python click_argument.py 10 20\nUsage: click_argument.py [OPTIONS] X Y Z\n\nError: Missing argument &quot;z&quot;.\n\n$ python click_argument.py 10 20 30 40\nUsage: click_argument.py [OPTIONS] X Y Z\n\nError: Got unexpected extra argument (40)\n不定参数\nargument 还有另外一种常见的用法，就是接收不定量的参数，让我们看看例子：\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.argument(&#39;src&#39;, nargs=-1)\n@click.argument(&#39;dst&#39;, nargs=1)\ndef move(src, dst):\n    click.echo(&#39;move %s to %s&#39; % (src, dst))\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    move()\n\n其中，nargs=-1 表明参数 src 接收不定量的参数值，参数值会以 tuple 的形式传入函数。如果 nargs 大于等于 1，表示接收 nargs 个参数值，上面的例子中，dst 接收一个参数值。\n让我们看看执行情况：\n$ python click_argument.py file1 trash    # src=(&#39;file1&#39;,)  dst=&#39;trash&#39;\nmove (u&#39;file1&#39;,) to trash\n\n$ python click_argument.py file1 file2 file3 trash   # src=(&#39;file1&#39;, &#39;file2&#39;, &#39;file3&#39;)  dst=&#39;trash&#39;\nmove (u&#39;file1&#39;, u&#39;file2&#39;, u&#39;file3&#39;) to trash\n彩色输出\n在前面的例子中，我们使用 click.echo 进行输出，如果配合 colorama 这个模块，我们可以使用 click.secho 进行彩色输出，在使用之前，使用 pip 安装 colorama：\n$ pip install colorama\n看看例子：\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.option(&#39;--name&#39;, help=&#39;The person to greet.&#39;)\ndef hello(name):\n    click.secho(&#39;Hello %s!&#39; % name, fg=&#39;red&#39;, underline=True)\n    click.secho(&#39;Hello %s!&#39; % name, fg=&#39;yellow&#39;, bg=&#39;black&#39;)\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    hello()\n\n其中:\n\nfg 表示前景颜色（即字体颜色），可选值有：BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE 等；\nbg 表示背景颜色，可选值有：BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE 等；\nunderline 表示下划线，可选的样式还有：dim=True，bold=True 等；\n\n小结\n\n使用 click.command() 装饰一个函数，使其成为命令行接口。\n使用 click.option() 添加可选参数，支持设置固定长度的参数值。\n使用 click.argument() 添加固定参数，支持设置不定长度的参数值。\n\n参考资料\n\nClick Documentation (6.0)\nPython Click 学习笔记 | I sudo X\nclick模块 - cdwanze\n\n"},"Conclusion/":{"url":"Conclusion/","title":"结束语","body":"结束语\n到这里，虽然本书结束了，但关于 Python 的学习还没结束，后面我也会持续更新本书。虽然 Python 的语法比较简单，但想熟练使用仍需在实际的项目中多实践，而不只是简单地停留在概念学习中。\n本章主要推荐 Python 相关的一些学习资源，同时也列出本书的主要参考资料。\n\n资源推荐\n参考资料\n\n"},"Conclusion/resource_recommendation.html":{"url":"Conclusion/resource_recommendation.html","title":"资源推荐","body":"资源推荐\n\naosabook/500lines: 500 Lines or Less\n  Python 神书，里面有若干个项目，每个项目都是由业内大神所写，每个项目代码在 500 行左右。\n\nvinta/awesome-python: A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources\n  包含了 Python 框架、Python 库和软件的 awesome 列表。\n\n\n"},"Conclusion/reference_material.html":{"url":"Conclusion/reference_material.html","title":"参考资料","body":"参考资料\n本书的参考资料主要有：\n\n《Python 基础教程》\n《Python 核心编程》\n廖雪峰 python 教程\npython3-cookbook 2.0.0 文档\n\n"}}}
